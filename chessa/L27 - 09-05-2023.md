In the following diagram we compare the load versus the supply of solar energy based sensors:
![[Pasted image 20230509145820.png]]
The battery level in sensors run differen task from $0:00$ AM to $12:00$ PM: sensors are recharged with solar panels and running different duty cycles and thus different load.
From the collected data we highlight that the sensors $1$ and $7$ consume more energy than that available while the sensor $6$ and $5$ do not exploit all the energy produced.

Having both a lower and higher energy consumption result in *inefficiencies*: for the first case, the sensing activity is not **sustainable in the long term**, for the second, the sensing activity **could be much more work intensive**, performing major energy consumption and allowing high quality sampling. 
Between the two cases, there are *energy neutral devices* in which the energy consumption is the sustainable due to the fact that the energy at the beginning of a timeframe is the same energy at the end.

A device is defined **energy neutral** if it can keep the desired performance *"forever"*: this also simplify the mantainance operations, without involding battery replacing or load modulation.

The design of those devices involves two main considerations:
- **Energy neutral operations**: define how operate in a given timeframe using always less energy than the harvested one. 
- **Maximum performance**: compute the maximum performance level tht can be supported in a given harvesting environment. This point can be solved by formalizing the workload behavior as a linear problem and apply operational research problem throgh a solver tool. 

Those design involves tuning each of the component involved, including the network components which manages the communication with other dervices: a well-designed systems try to guarantee the energy neutrality not only to a single device but as a fleet of devices and design the server component of the entire architecture respect to the local choices of the devices (*e.g. low duty cycle must be acknoledge by a central server so it expect lower data transmission in case of energy consumption reduction*).

The following image shows the **load** compared to a generic **supply** over a day: the energy production increase during daytime, allowing to store it when the energy production is above the required by the device load.

The **power consumption** of the device is modulated to ensure energy neutrality: this parameter is computed by an *analytical model* as an approximation of the real power consumtpion at a given time.  The other three parameters that are used in the analytical model can be measured in an accurate way, allowing to obtain:
- The **amount of harvested energy** from each source
- The **current charge of the battery**
- The **future energy production**

The *monitoring* of those parameters allows to compare it to the analytical model and introduce optimization overtime, if necessary.
The *future energy estimation* can be based on several methods like *weather forecast* despite it can be subject to errors. Usually the forecast method it's based under pessimistic assumption thus the errors are maximazed and the *expected production* is minimized.


### Harvest-store-use architecture revisited
The harvest-store-use model use an harvester for future use thus the energy is used later when either there are no harvesting opportunities or the sensor taska require more energy. The general model is pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230509151317.png]]
The **energy prediction** components needs a model of the energy source and specific information taken from the *harvester* itself or through *external components* like weather forecast or third-party services. 
The **scheduler** takes in input the *energy production* from the energy harvester and the *energy expenditure* from the energy buffer and take scheduling decision based on the analytical model, update by the *energy predictor* and based on the real data provided by the *energy harvester*.

Here we describe two main models for **energy neutrality** known and used in literature.

### Kansalâ€™s approach
This approach is based on underlying assumption about the energy source: it must be **predictable** but **uncontrollable**. In presence of unpredictable source the problem of forecast the production require a more complex model of the source and its behavior thus guaranteeing performance become difficult.
The uncontrollability of the source constraint is given due to the fact that if it would be controllable then the energy production can be activated on demand when necessary.

The approach focuses on take the **current and expected battery charge** into account, dynamically tune the device's performance by *tuning the duty cycle* (*which is the only parameter to be tuned in the Kansal approach*) and thus modify the **load**. This allows to ensure that the device operates below minimum performance levels nor switches OFF before the next 
recharge cycle.

The model proposed by Kansal is valid under some hypothesis, here presented.

###### Condition 1: energy production
The energy production, according to Kansal, can be  approximated as a **linear source**: this implies that the growth is bounded by *two parallel line* with an angle of $\rho_{s}$ . 
![[Pasted image 20230509152717.png]]

The **amount of energy** **produced**  $E_{T}$ in an interval $[0,T]$ is:
						$E_{T} = \int_{T}P_{s}(T)dt$ 
such that:
				$\rho_{s} \times T - \alpha \leq E_{T} \leq \rho_{s} \times T + \alpha$
for some $\rho_{s}, \alpha$ *real numbers*.

The *linearity of the source* is reasonable, expecially for the sun as a energy source.

###### Condition 2: load
The second condition is imposed on the **load**: according to Kansal, the load can be **bounded linearly** by finding the correct coefficincy.
The **amount of energy consumed** $L_{T}$in an interval $[0,T]$ is:
$L_{T} = \int_{T}P_{c}(t)dt$
such that:
	$0 \le L_{T} \le \rho_{c} \times T+\delta$
for some $\rho_{c}, \delta$ real numbers.
![[Pasted image 20230510084605.png]]


The **Kansal theorem** is valid under the previous assumption of $E_{T}$ and $L_{T}$ and if the energy buffer is a real one, charaterized by **energy efficiency $\mu$** and **leakage $\rho_{leak}$**. 
The theorem states that a ***sufficient condition*** for energy neutrality of the system is:
![[Pasted image 20230509153439.png]]
The first branch of the definition states that the *energy production* grows more than the *consumption and leakage*. This condition regards the **runtime load** and not the overall system during *idle* state and at *start time*.

The constrains given by Kansal allows to **avoid oversizing** the energy production solution by providing larger batteries and solar panels.

#### Utility and duty cycle measurements
The main purpose of the Kansal constraints allows also to have a *useful duty cycle*: he introduce the concept of the *utility* in the DC that describe operations in DC which are useful for the device purpose and not avoid performing operation due to insufficient energy.

The proposed model allows to ensure the two conditions already mentioned, here summarized:
1. *Condition 1*: on power production, assume it fits
2. *Condition 2*: on the load, allows to adjust dynamicaly the duty cycle

Kansal introduced a relationship between the *duty cycle $dc$ and *utility* $u(dc)$ of the application: 
![[Pasted image 20230509154741.png]]

To this aim, we also define the **max utility** $u_{M}$ and **min utility** $u_{m}$ associated with the **maximum duty cycle** $dc_{min}$ and **minimum duty cycle** $dc_{min}$. This parameters allow to define a range in which the operations are useful and are not a waste of energy (*e.g. sampling frequency for infrared alarm, not too fast and too slow*).
![[Pasted image 20230509154808.png]]

##### Example
Let define:
-  $dc_{max} = 90\%$
- $dc_{min} = 50\%$
- $u_{max} = 100$
- $u_{min} = 10$
hence:
$\alpha = \frac{u_{max}-u_{min}}{dc_{max}-dc_{min}} = \frac{90}{40} = 2.25$
$\beta = u_{min}-\alpha \times dc_{min} = -102.5$
thus
$u(dc) = 2.25 \times dc - 102.5$
![[Pasted image 20230509162158.png]]
Assume that:
- $dc_{max} = 90\%$ corresponds to a consumption of $p_{max} = 5mA$
- $dc_{min} = 50\%$ corresponds to a consumption of $p_{min} = 1 mA$
and that the power consumption is **linear with the duty cycle**. Hence:
				$p(dc) = \rho \times dc + \alpha$
where
			$\rho = \frac{p_{max}-p_{min}}{dc_{max}-dc_{min}} = \frac{4}{40} = 0.1$
			$\alpha = p_{min}-\rho \times dc_{min} = -4$


![[Pasted image 20230509162726.png]]

Indirectly, the model express a relation between *energy* and *duty cycle* passing through utility measure: the above diagram shows the linearity of the power consumption respect to the dc.

#### Duty cycle modulation
This model of utility and duty cycle allows for **modulation of the load on the energy harvesting device** despite changing overtime the DC involves make *practical considerations*: the sampling sensor involves using the transducer that produce data points. The sampling work well (*for a theoretical result known as Sampling Theorem*) if the sampling if equally spaced, at regular time.
Changing the DC **modify the sampling frequency indirectly**, possible messing up the data points sampled.
To avoid this problem is needed to **sample at the same frequency for a given amount of time**: this allows to perform fourier analysis and obtain correctly the measurements. 

Kansal allows to modulate the *duty cycle* by introducing the concept of ***slot***: in each slot the sampling frequency is guaranteed for a limited timeframe thus the disruption of the measurement is avoided.
The scheduler, based on the previous input parameters, decide the schedule of the slots, trying to maximize the utility by mantaining the power consumption under the oblique max linea of the previous diagram.

The optimization problem formulated by Kansal is now shifted: assume the time is *slotted* and in each time slot is setted one duty cycle. Consider also a timeframe of 24 hours so the optimization is daily based: use forecast to estimate the energy production of the entire day.

As previously seen in this chapter, the *power harvested, stored* and *consumed* in a generic slot $i$ follow the assumption that the power **consumed** in idle mode is $0$ and that the power **production** is constant in the same slot. Thus, formalizing the consumed/produced energy, we have:
- $p_{s}(i)$: power harvested in slot $i$
- $p_{c}(i)$: power load in slot $i$


The following two diagrams consider the energy consumption/production parameters: on the left, if the consumption is more than the production and the device is in *active* state then there is no storage because the harvested energy is used to perform the active duty cycle operations. Differently, if the device is in *idle* state, the harvested energy is stored, following the energy buffer model already  seen. 
![[Pasted image 20230509165631.png]]

The diagram on the right contemplate in case of the energy consumption is less than the energy production: in this case during the *active* mode we're able to store partially the harvested energy while in *idle* mode we're able to save almost all of the entire produced energy (*discarding real model parameters like battery efficiency and storage leakage*).

### Kansal's optimization problem formalization

To formalize the optimization problem and solve it, the approach use three main components:
- forecast future power prediction based on the production of the past, considering their relative weight using *EWMA*.
- use a *polynomial-time* algorithm, optimal for low-powered devices, to solve the optimization problem
- performs **reoptimization** by implementing dynamic adaptation of the duty cycle if the actual energy production significantly deviates from the expected one

The formalization involves defining those parameters:
- $k$ be the *number of slots* in a day
- $B(i)$ be the battery charge at the beginning of slot $i$
- $B(k+1)$ be the battery level at the end of slot $k$ (*e.g. end of the day*)
Based on the **expected power production** $\tilde{\rho}_{s}(i)$ at *each  $i \in [1,k]$* assign a *duty cycle*  $dc(i)$ and hence a utility $u(i)$ to each slot such that:
	$B(k+1) \geq B(1)$
so that the system must be *energy neutral*.


The model based on *EWMA - Exponentially Weighted Moving Average* catch well long timeframe forecast, while outlier can disrupt the forecast (*e.g. during cloudy days*). The EWMA for the forecast is made upon assumption that the production in a slot in a day will be similar to that of the day before. To this aim, define:
- $p_{s}^{j}(i)$ be the **actual power production** in slot $i$ in day $j$ (*measured*)
- $\tilde{p}_{s}^{j}(i)$ be the **estimated power production** in slot $i$ in day $j$
The estimated power production in the same slot $i$ in the next day $j+1$ is given by:
			$\tilde{p}_{s}^{j+1}(i) = \alpha \tilde{p}_{s}^{j}(i) + (1-\alpha)\tilde{p}_{s}^{j}(i)$
where $\alpha < 1$  is a parameter that can be costant or dynamically adjusted based on the estimation errors comparison with actual production. 

### Algorithm
Assume that the **actual power production** matches the *estimated power production* and let:
- $p_{max}$ be the power consumption when operating at maximum dc $dc_{max}$
- $p_{min}$ be the power consumption when operating at minimum dc $dc_{min}$
Consider the two sets
- **Sun slots**: $S = \{i \in [1,k]: \tilde{p}_{s}^{j}(i) \geq p_{max}\}$ which is the set of slots with ***overproduction***
- **Dark slots**: $D = \{i \in [1,k]: \tilde{p}_{s}^{j}(i) < p_{max}\}$ which is the set of slosts with ***underproduction***

The first solution, possibly non-optimum and not even admissable would be:
$dc_{i} = dc_{max} \forall i \in S$
$dc_{i} = dc_{min} \forall i \in D$
It assign the maximum dc in the sun slots and the minimum dc in the dark slots, thus, in order to optimize the overall *utility* we have two options:
1. Having a *surplus* of power production at the end of the day
2. Having a *underproduction* of power at the end of the day


###### Case 1: overproduction
The surplus of production at the end of the day can be resitributed in some slots: as Kansal defined the problem, we can put the surplus in the dark slots but this will not change the utility of the slot. 
![[Pasted image 20230509172945.png]]
The basic idea is that while the **residual energy $p_{r}$** is above the difference of $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$, raise the dark slot $i$ to the maximum dc by $dc_{i} = dc_{max}$. This create the problem of remaining with a residue which is not sufficient to increase to the maximum: in this case (*bottom `if` check*) the increase is not able to reach $dc_{max}$ but still the slot $i$ will be increment by a quantity returned by the `DutyCcle(...)` function.


###### Case 2: underproduction
![[Pasted image 20230510093207.png]]
Democratically reduce each slot of the same quantity $p_{u}$, reducing the duty cycle to $dc_{min}$: if the underproduction is very high, thus the reduction is too drastic as checked by the condition $p_{max}-p_{u}/|S| < p_{min}$ , the probelm is not ammisible. In case of ammisibility, it bring drown the same quantity for each slot.

This model is valid under condition that the enegy production is the same of the expected one: if not true, the scheduler intervene at the start of each slot, adapting based on the updated threshold allowing to take advtange of an overproduction of making sure the system remains *energy neutral* in case of underproduction.

#### Highlights and drawbacks
The Kansal's algorithm is able to reaches the optimum and it's  suitable even on Arduino: the memory usage can be lowered by expanding the slots and reducing the array of previous day weights.

The main drawbacks is the underlying assumption is that the DC **scale linear** hence the sampling activity of a sensor will, in general, have irregular sampling frequencies, which may not be the best thing for some applications.
It's also difficult to model complex behavior, like choosin between alternative transducer to achieve sampling task or use different processing algorithms because the **duty cycle modulation** is able to adapt the load to the *real power production*.
