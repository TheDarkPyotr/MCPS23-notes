#### 3. ZigBee Device Object (ZDO)
ZDO is a *special application* attached to ***endpoint `0`***: it implement the basic functionalities expected by the devices. It also implement the end-device or router or coordinator based on the specific configuration given by the **ZigBee Device Profile** that describe the cluster that must be supported by any ZigBee device, defines how the ZDO implements the services of discovery and binding and how it maanges the network and security. 
So the main ZDO services are:
- Device and service discovery
- Binding management
- Network management
- Node management

##### Device and service discovery
The **ZigBee Device Profile** specifies the device and the *service discovery mechanisms* to obtain any information about devices and services in the network. The **device discovery** allows a device to obtain the (*network or MAC*) address of other devices in the network: starting from an unknown address it allows to identify the relative device inside the network. It follow an **hierarchical implementation** in which a router return to its parent its address and the address of all the end-devices is associated to itself. Then the coordinator returns the address of its associated devices. 

A newly joined device does not know anything about the network: to provide a service it must also known, require and use the services offered  by other devices. This actions are performed thanks to **ZigBee Devie Profile** that allows thhe service discovery of other devices.
The service discovery send queries that are based on *cluster ID* or *service descriptors*: the coordinator responds to service discovery queries by returning lists of endpoint addresses matching with the query: the hierarchical implementation is effective because *each router colelct information from its associated devices and forwards it to its parents*. 

The other mechanism to understand what service a device is providing is called **Device Discovery**: the network is created according to a parent-child relation (with a coordinator), building as a tree (as the addresses tree previously mentioned). To known which service a device offer, a joined device ask to its coordinator that may not have fully all the information and may ask to it's parent node, recursively. Each node is responsible for the subtree under its domain: in case of missing information, intermediate routers prepare information report to answer the queries.

The **Service Discovery** provides a report that tells for a single device what are the cluster to which it responds: for example, a device can responds telling that implement a ON/OFF cluster. The service discovery can be direct to the coordinator and is it's responsability to collect information and answer for the whole network. 
The requests can be directed also to end-device but due to low-power devices, they may not be ready to answer the queries regarding the services they offer. 
The service discovery does not tell where the device is physically located, only the service offered and their relative identifier (Cluster ID, Device ID, etc): to obtain the location is necessary that a device implements the **Identify Cluster** that force a device to identify itself by blinking a led. 

##### Binding management
The ZDO processes the binding requests received from local or remote EP: both to add entries and delete entries from the APS binding table (*by invoking primitives*). This process require having an IEEE address. 

##### Managing network and nodes
The *network management* implements the protocols of the coordinator, a router or an end-device accordin gto the configuration settings established either via a programmed application or at installation. Differently, the *node management* involves the ZDO to serves incoming requests aimed at perfoming network discover, retrieving the routing and binding tables of the device and managing `join/leaves` of nodes to the network.

### ZigBee Cluster Library (ZCL)
The ZCL is a repostory for cluster functionalities: it's a *working library* with regular updates and new functionalities. The develoeprs are expected to use the ZCL to find relevant cluster funcionalities to use for their application. 
The main goal is to avoid re-inventing the wheel, supports **interoperability** and facilitates maintanability: two devices must implement the same application layer to use each other. The ZCL allows to implement the same set of commands and functionalities, standardized by ZCL. 
Let's see an example applied ina  home automation cluster:

![[Pasted image 20230311165002.png]]


In a base home automation system we have many application execute at the same moment: the ZCL allows to specify the behaviours of the involved devices based on a ***client-server model***.

A **cluster is a collection of commands and attributes**, which define an interface to a specific functionality.
The **device** that stores the attributes, by keeping an internal state, is the **server of the cluster** while  the device that manipulates/writes the attributes is the **client of the cluster**.
It's not necessary that a server have more computational power than end-devices. 
![[Pasted image 20230311165232.png]]
*If we think an application that switch the light, it will have an attribute `ON/OFF` and the client will be the switch that turn on/off the light while the server will be the light bulb itself. *
Cluster are grouped in **functional domains**:
- *General*: allows the access and control of any device, irrespective of their functional domain. Includes general basic functions, implemented by all devices.
- *Closures*:  for shade controllers, door locks. 
- *HVAC*: for pumps (*like fan, heating, etc*)
- *Lighting*: control lights
- *Measurement and sensing*: illuminance, presence, flow, humidity
- *Security and Safety*: security zone devices (*e.g. passive infrared*)
- *Protocol interfaces*: interconenct with other protocols 
Each functional domain, for each server, defines **commands** and **message structure**. 
The **commands** are messages (*with their own header and paylaod*) with a format specified by ZCL: the commands can be read/write attribute or also can be used for dynamic attribute reporting (*useful to periodic reading of the sensors*). 
The *types of command* are generally tree:
1. Read/write an attribute
2. Configure a report and read a reporting response:  allows to request periodic attribute/configuration reading. Requests for report whenever an attribute/configuration changes. The client ask the server to report periodicly about the state of the server: the server will send periodically a report to the client, withoyt any further request. Also defines parameters of the reporting like *duration, period, minimum change, etc*.
3. Discover attributes: to discover the IDs and types of the attributes of the cluster that are supported by the server

The *schemes of use* show a typical use of **device configuration and installation cluster:** the configuration phase allows to setting up some parameters by using several clusters.
The `Basic` allows to retrieve software version, manufacturer ID, etc. The `PowerConfig` return information about battery and power configuration. The `Temperature Configuration` allows to set treshold, etc. Last, the `Identify` cluster allows to identify physically a device. 
![[Pasted image 20230311165919.png]]
Following the schema, usually the installer configure the devices by using specific configuration tools that allows to connect to the devices, apply the specific settings and read their status. As an example, the `Identify` allows to recognize the device by enabling a blinking led. 

Applied to our `ON/OFF` previous example:
![[Pasted image 20230311165957.png]]


In this case we want to configure a set of APO, we have one
ON/OFF switch which is connected with a "*Simple Lamp*", we have to
create the association between the lamp and the switch, in the same way we must also create the association between the "dimmer switch" and the "dimmable lamp".
This association is created by the **Configuration Tool**, working as a client sets the configuration of the On/Off switch device in such a way that when it wants to turn the lamp on or off it will find the corresponding device and make the request for turning on or off. The same goes for configuring the Dimmer Switch. The configuration tool must also configure the simple lamp. The configuration allows to setup the **binding table** to the **coordinator** by knowing the addresses of the devices and relative APO. This can be done by invoking device and service discovery, alongside physical discovery.
Typically what happens is that the installer has a tablet and it connects to the Zigbee Network, using an application you can access information about the network. When I run this configuration each device knows what it is and what it can do, a lamp for example knows it is a lamp but it is necessary to carry out a **commissioning procedure** so that the lamp is connected to an on/off switch which allows the ignition. It's necessary to execute the procedure of *commissioning* to simplify the deployment of complex smart system, like in a scenario with hundreds of devices to be deployed and configured. 

Each devices has many of information assigned to it, contained in the `BASIC` cluster, like:
![[Pasted image 20230311170348.png]]
The `ZCLVersion` is mandatory to be sure that the ZCL is the right one implemented at application level, specially due to continue updating.
Also the  `PowerSource` is mandatory because provide information about power sources. Usually the  attributes in `BASIC` cluster are in *read-only* access. 

Among those information, highly relevant are the `PowerSource`, an 8-bit number that can have those values:
![[Pasted image 20230311170452.png]]
The value in the last table indicates the **type of battery**, if there is an emergency power supply, etc. Those devices have also the attribute called **tempetature measurement cluster** that allows to kown the tempetature *inside* the device itself. 
The attribute to know this temperature are the following, as specified by `Temperature` cluster:
![[Pasted image 20230311170646.png]]
The cluster specified uses only generic commands to *read attributes, discover attributes, configure and report.* There are no specific commands to program a simple devices as a temperature measurement.For complex devices that also implement part of the `Temperature` cluster there is usually an accessory appendix that specify other commands. 

###### Combining clusters
ZCL is designed to enforce a hierarchical approach to device functionality by supporting backward compatibility and interoperability: instead of design every possible ZCL cluster for specific *lamp*, it's incremental and allows compatibility by also let the possiblity to create custom features not standardized by ZigBee.

## ZigBee Security Specification
Security services provided for ZigBee include methods for:
1. key establishment: create the keys without prior information
2. key transport: exchange keys previously setted/stored at configuration
3. frame protection: by using encryption
4. device management
Security services are optional and have an overhead, minimum for low power devices, 
These services form the building blocks for implementing security policies within a ZigBee device. 
The underlying assumptions are that **level of security** depends on:
- the safekeeping of the symmetric keys: by avoiding stolen information about keys, also physically  
- the protection mechanisms employed, 
- the proper implementation of the cryptographic mechanisms and associated security policies involved.
**Trust** in the security architecture comes from: 
- trust in the ***secure initialization*** and installation of keying material and 
- trust in the ***secure processing and storage*** of keying material.

Further assumptions are:
- **correct implementation of all security protocols**: the  implementation must follow the standard, according to ZigBee standard and deployment operations
- correct random number generators 
- secret keys do not become available outside the device in an unsecured way. The only exception to this is when a device joins the network.

Due to the *low-cost nature of ZigBee devices* we **cannot generally assume the availability of tamper resistant hardware**: it's possiible to some extent but it's not provided by the ZigBee standard (*can be possible by anti tamper hardware to a given point*).  The level of protecntion is both at network level of physical level.  Hence, physical access to a device may yield access to secret keying material and other privileged information, as well as access to the security software and hardware. Also, **different APO in the same device are not logically separated and lower layers are entirely accessible to the application layer**. Hence different APO in the same device must trust each other.


##### Security Design Choices
The security is granted by the **Trust Center** that it's a module in the *Application Layer*, tipycally allocated in the *ZDO* that distribute the security keys to the devices inside the same network. 
Two main keys are provided, at different level:
- **Single key per network** (*network level security*)
- **Single key per link** (*device-to-device level security*)
The process flows: the devices inside the network uses a **Master key** to connect to the **Trust center**: this master key can be pre-assigned to the device (*write in ROM/Firmware*) or can be injected later in the device. The master key allows to establish a connection to request  the **Network keys** or **Link keys**.  Those three key allows ZigBee to provide a level of encryption corresponding to $AES-128$ that it's enough for low power devices. The keys are provided by the APS. The low power and computing constraints of the devices implies that the encryption is **symmetric** and the decryption is made by the keys provided by the *application layer*. 
It aims to the protection of individual devices but not individual applciations in the same device: this allows the re-use of the same keying material among the different layers of the same device.


The layer that originates a frame is responsible for initially securing it: if a network command need protection this must be ensured at network level security. If protection from *theft of service* is required, network layer security must be used for all frames (*except the one when new device joins*). The reuse of key materials among different layers in a device and link-keys allows to have additional security from source to destination: an application can extends the security by adding other mechanism but it's entirely upon itself. 

An *application profiles* should include policies to:
- *Handle error conditions arising from securing and unsecuring packets: error conditions may indicate loss of synchronization of security material or may indicate ongoing attacks. 
- Detect and handle loss of counter synchronization and counter overflow. 
- Detect and handle loss of key synchronization. 
- Expire and periodically update keys, if desired.

#### The keys

The keys can be obtained by means of:
- Key transport: a mechanism for communcating a key from one device to another dervice or other device. It's a sensible phase because at that time the communication is unencypted: can be encrypted but with more overhead, depending the scenario context. 
- Key establishment: a mechanism that involves the execution of a #todo
- Pre-installation: at manufacturing time, install the key into the device or during the deploying phase

The **Network key** are *128-bit* shared by all devices: they are acquired either by key-transport or pre-installation and generally are of two types (***standard vs high security***).
The **Link keys** are 128 bit, shared by all devices: they are acquired by key-transport, key-establishment or pre-installation. THe key establishment is based on pre-existing master key. Two types are considered (***Global vs Unique***).
The **Master key** is a 128 bit key acquired either by key transport or pre-installation. Other keys are used to implement the secure transport of key material: they are derived from the link key with one-way functions. 


The **Key Establishment** it's stated by the specification, it describe a variation of DIffie-Hellmann ant its' called SKKE ()  #todo 


### Trust Center
It's a funcionality implemented in the coordinator or a specified device: in a simple network can be the coordinator. It's used to obtain new network/link key by connecting to it and requesting new keys.


Once to join in a network (by already having the master key), you connect to the Trust Center and request the other two types of keys.



# Case Study: Industrial IoT for smart greenhouse

Two different sectors: the upper part is provided with the default sensors like *temperature, fertilization system, humidity,etc* while in the bottom part are located more specialized and complex logic control link of the appliances and fertilization systems. 
Both sectors are divided into different two subsectors:
