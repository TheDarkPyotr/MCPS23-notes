# IEEE 802.15.4 Standard
*The following chapter is entirely based on "J. Zheng and A. Jamalipour, Wireless Sensor Networks: A Networking Perspective, Wiley-IEEE Press"*.

The **IEEE 802.15.4 standard** specifies the **physical** and **MAC layers** for low-rate wireless *Personal Area Networks (PAN)*. Its protocol stack is simple and flexible, it does not require any infrastructure and it is suitable for short-range communications (*typically within a range of 10 meters*). 
For these reasons it features ease of installation, low cost, and a reasonable battery life of the devices.
The physical layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 has been designed to coexist with other IEEE standards for wireless networks such as *IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth)*. It features activation and deactivation of the radio transceiver and transmission of packets on the physical medium. It operates in one of the following three license-free bands:
- $868–868.6 MHz$ (*e.g., Europe*) with a data rate of $20$ kbps;
- $902–928 MHz$ (*e.g., North America*) with a data rate of $40$ kbps; or
- $2400–2483.5 MHz$ (*worldwide*) with a data rate of $250$ kbps.

The MAC layer provides ***data and management services*** to the upper layers. The **data service** enables transmission and reception of MAC packets (*Protocol Data Unit (PPDU)*) across the physical layer. 
The **management services** include synchronization of the communications, management of guaranteed time slots, and association and disassociation of devices to the network. This is performed by a set of features like **Energy Detection (ED), Link Quality Indicator (LQI)** (*that allows to chose the best channel for a given communication*), **Channel Selection**, **Clearl Channel Assessment (CCA)**, etc (*More information later*). In addition the MAC layer implements basic security mechanisms.

### Physical layer
There are several channels operating at different frequencies ($Mhz$) as pictured here: the lower channels are used for short range devices (*baby monitor, automatic gate remote controller, etc*) while the upper channels (*11-26*) are for large range of communications.
![[Pasted image 20230409093421.png]]

It's designed to operate well even in highly noisy environment: the physical channel is designed to be more robust respect to Bluettoth as shown in the following diagram.
![[Pasted image 20230409094546.png]]
As mentioned in the previous chapters, the **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** is a measure of the strength of a signal relative to the background noise present in a given environment or system. It is expressed as a ratio of the *signal power* to the *noise power*, typically measured in decibels ($dB$).

In communication systems, the signal refers to the information or data that is being transmitted, while noise refers to any unwanted or random fluctuations in the signal. **The higher the SNR, the better the quality of the signal and the more accurate the transmission of information**. Conversely, a low SNR indicates a weaker signal that is more susceptible to errors and interference from noise.

The **Energy Detection (ED)** is used to find a free channel and for carrier sense: the estimation time for ED equals the average over 8 sumbols interval. The **detection threshold** is at $10dB$ above the sensitivity level.
The **Link Quality Indicator (LQI)** indicates the quality of data packets that are received by a node: it's based on ED or on the *signal/noise ratio*. It's assesed each time a packet is received and must contemplate 8 different levels of quality.
The estimated value for *LQI* is forwarded to the network and application layers.

For the **Channel Assessment**, the main objective is to detect if the channel is *busy* and operates in 3 modes:
- **Mode 1**: uses ED; if the energy level exceeds the detection threshold, then the channel is marked as *busy*. 
- **Mode 2**: perform *Carrier Sense*, the channel is *busy* if the detected signal has the same characteristics as the sender. 
- **Mode 3**: Combination of modes 1 et 2 (*AND/OR*).


#### Data services
At the *physical layer*, the *PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit)* reports the rsult of the transmission to the upper layer (*if successfull or failed*). The main reason for a transmission to fail are:
1. radio transceiver *out of order*
2. radio transceiver is in the *reception mode*
3. radio transceiver is *busy*

The **frame** have the structure pictured in the following image:

![[Pasted image 20230409095527.png]]
It's composed by:
- **SHR (Synchronization Header)**: synchronisation with the receiver
- **PHR (PHY Header)**: information about the frame length
- **PHY Payload**: the MAC frame
- **SFD (Start-of-frame delimiter)** : tell the receiver that the real data is beginning
- **PSDU (Physical Service Data Unit)**: it's the actual payload, up to $127$ bytes. It's not a good idea to use all of them all despite are only few bytes: with long frames there are problem of carrier sense and multiple access. 



### MAC Layer
Also at the MAC Layer, we can differentiate three different types of services:
1. ***Data services***: transmission and reception of **MAC frames (MPDU)** across the physical layer.
2. ***Managament services***: perform *synchronization of the communications, channel access, management of guaranteed time slots,association and disassociation of devices.
3. ***Security services***: allows *data encryption, access control, frame integrity and sequential freshness*.

The MAC layer defines two types of nodes: ***Reduced Function Devices (RFDs)*** and ***Full Function Devices (FFDs)***. 
**RFD** are meant to implement end-devices with reduced processing, memory, and communication capabilities which implement a subset of the MAC layer functions. In particular the RFD can only associate to an existing network and they depend on **FFDs** for communication. One *RFD* can be associated to only one FFD at a time. Example of RFD devices are simple sensors or actuators like light switches,
lamps and similar devices.
The ***FFDs*** implement the full MAC layer and they can act aither as the *Personal Area Network (PAN)* coordinator or as a generic coordinator of a set of RFDs. The PAN coordinator sets up and manages the network, in particular it selects the PAN identifier and manages associations or disassociation of devices.
In the association phase the PAN coordinator assigns to the new device a 16 bit address. This address can be used in alternative to the standard 64 bit extended IEEE address which is statically assigned to each device.

![[Pasted image 20230409100959.png]]


The FFDs cooperate to implement the **network topology**. The actual network formation is performed at the network layer, but the MAC layer provides support to two types of network topologies: ***star*** and ***peer-to-peer*** (*as shown in the previous image*).
In the **star topology** one FFD is the PAN coordinator and it is located in the star centre.  All the other FFD and RFD behave as generic devices and they can only communicate with the coordinator which synchronizes all the communications in the network.  Different stars operating in the same area have different PAN identifier and operate independently of each other.

In the **peer to peer topology** each FFD is capable of communicating with any other device within its radio range. One *FFD (normally the FFD which initiated the network)* act as PAN coordinator, and the other *FFDs* act as routers or end devices to form a multihop network as shown in the previous figure. The *RFDs* act as
end devices and each RFD is connected only with one *FFD*.


### Channel access
The MAC protocol have two channel access: 
1. **superframe structure**:is used in star topologies (*it can also be used in peer to peer topologyes organized in trees*) and provides synchronization between nodes to enable energy savings of the devices.
2. **no superframe structure**: is more general and can be used to support communications in arbitrary peer to peer topologies.


#### 1. Access with superframe
A superframe is composed by an **active** and an **inactive** portion. All the communications happen during the active portion, hence the *PAN coordinator (and the connected devices)* may enter a *low power (sleep)* mode during the inactive portion. The active portion comprises up to *16* **equally sized time slots**. 
The first time slots is the ***beacon frame*** and is sent by the PAN coordinator to begin the superframe. The beacon frames are used to synchronize the attached devices, to identify the PAN, and to describe the structure of the superframes. 

The actual communications between the end devices and the coordinator take place in the *remaining time slots*. The time slots in the active portion are divided into a ***Contention Access Period (CAP)*** and a (*optional*) ***Contention Free Period (CFP)***.

![[Pasted image 20230409102712.png]]

In the **CAP period** the devices compete for channel access using a standard slotted *CSMA-CA protocol (Carries Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)*.  This means that a device wishing to transmit data frames first waits for the beacon frame and then it *randomly selects a time slot for its transmission*: if the selected time slot is busy because another communication is already ongoing (*this is detected using carrier sense*) then the device selects randomly another time slot. If the channel is *idle*, the device can begin transmitting on the next slot.

The **CFP period** is optional and it is used for low-latency applications or applications requiring specific data bandwidth. To this purpose the PAN coordinator may assign portions of the active superframe (*called
**Guaranteed Time Slots** or GTS*) to specific applications. The GTSs form the **contention-free period (CFP)**, which always begins at the end of the active superframe starting at a slot boundary immediately following the CAP. Each GTS may comprise more than one time slots and it is assigned to an individual application which access it without contention.
![[Pasted image 20230409103442.png]]
In any case the PAN coordinator *always leave a sufficient number of frames for the CAP period for the other devices and to manage the ssociation/disassociation protocols*. Note also that all contention-based transactions shall be complete before the beginning of the CFP, and each device transmitting in a GTS shall complete its transmission within its GTS.

The PAN coordinator may optionally avoid the the use of the **superframe structure** (*thus the PAN is called **non beacon-enabled**)*. In this case the PAN coordinator never sends beacons and communication happens on the basis of the ***unslotted CSMA-CA protocol***. The coordinator is always on and ready to receive data from an end-device while data transfer in the opposite direction is **poll-based**: the end device periodically wakes up and polls the coordinator for pending messages. The coordinator responds to this request by sending the pending messages or by signalling that no messages are available


### Data transfer models 
The standard supports three models of data transfer: 
1. end device to the coordinator (*or router*), 
2. coordinator (*or router*) to an end device
3. Peer to peer 
The **star topology** use only the first two models because the data transfers can happen only between the PAN coordinator and the other devices. In the peer to **peer topology** all the three models are possible since data can be exchanged between any pair of devices. The actual implementation of the three data transfer models depends on whether the network supports the transmission of beacons, thus obtaining two network models: *beacon-enabled vs non-beacon enabled*. 

#### Data transfers in beacon-enabled networks
**Data transfer from an end-device to a coordinator**: The end device first waits for the network beacon to synchronize with the superframe. When the beacon is received, if it owns a GTS it directly use it, otherwise it transmits the data frame to the coordinator using the slotted CSMA-CA protocol in one of the frames in the CAP period. The coordinator may optionally acknowledge the successful reception of the data by transmitting an acknowledgment frame in a successive time slot. (Image A.)

**Data transfer from and to a coordinator to an end device**: The coordinator stores the message (*a data frame*) and it indicates in the network beacon that the data message is pending. The end-device usually sleeps most of the time and it *periodically listens to the network beacon to check for pending messages*. 
When it notice that a message is pending it explicitly requests the message to the coordinator using the **slotted CSMA-CA in the CAP period**. In turn, the coordinator sends the pending message in the **CAP period** using the slotted CSMA-CA. The device thus acknowledges the reception of the data by transmitting an acknowledgment frame in a **successive time slot** so that the coordinator can remove the pending message from its list.

![[Pasted image 20230417090745.png]]
**Peer-to-peer data transfers**: If the sender or the receiver is a end device then **one of the above schemes is used**. Otherwise both the source and the destination are coordinators and they issue their own beacons because two end-devices *cannot communicate directly*. In this case the sender must **first synchronize with the beacon of the destination** and act as an end device. The measures to be taken in order to synchronize coordinators are beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and are thus left to the upper layers.
![[Pasted image 20230417091003.png]]

#### Data transfers in non beacon-enabled networks
**Data transfer from an end device to a coordinator**: In this case the end device transmits directly its data frame to the coordinator using the **unslotted CSMA-CA protocol**. The coordinator acknowledges the successful reception of the data by transmitting an optional acknowledgment frame. (Image 5A)

**Data transfer from a coordinator to an end-device**: The coordinator stores the message (*a data frame*) and **waits for the appropriate device to request for the data**. A device can inquiry the coordinator for pending messages by transmitting a request using the *unslotted CSMA-CA protocol* (*this request happens at an application-defined rate*). 
The coordinator acknowledges the successful reception of the request by transmitting an **acknowledgment frame**. If there are pending messages, the coordinator transmits the messages to the device using the *unslotted CSMA-CA protocol*. Otherwise, if no messages are pending, the coordinator transmits a message with a **zero-length payload** (*which indicates that no messages are pending*). The device acknowledges the successful reception of the messages by transmitting an acknowledgment frame so that the coordinator can discard the pending messages.
![[Pasted image 20230417091534.png]]
**Peer to peer data transfer**: : In peer-to-peer PANs each device can communicate with each other device in its *radio range*. In order to do this effectively, the devices wishing to communicate need either to:
1. keep the **radio constantly active** in order to be ready to receive incoming messages or
2. to synchronize with each other. 
In the former case the device can directly transmit the data using *unslotted CSMA-CA* while in the second case the device has to wait until the destination device is ready to receive. Note however that the devices synchronization is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and it is left to the upper layers.

### MAC Layer service primitives
The MAC layer provide data and management services to the upper layer (*normally the ZigBee network layer*). Each service is specified by a **set of primitives** which can be of four generic types:
- **Request**: It is invoked by the upper layer to request for a specific service; 
- **Indication**: It is generated by the MAC layer and it is directed to the upper layer to notify the occurrence of an event related to a specific service; 
- **Response**: It is invoked by the upper layer to complete a procedure previously initiated by an indication primitive; 
- **Confirm**: It is generated by the MAC layer and is directed to the upper layer to convey the results of one or more service requests previously issued.
![[Pasted image 20230417091904.png]]

#### Data service
The data service comprises one main service which exploits only the `request`, `confirm` and `indication` primitives.
The `DATA.request` primitive is invoked by the upper layer to send a message to another device. The result of a transmission requested with a previous `DATA.request` primitive is reported by the MAC layer to the upper layer by the `DATA.confirm` primitive, which returns the status of transmission (*either success or an error code*). The `DATA.indication` primitive corresponds to a **"*receive*" primitive**: it is generated by the MAC layer on receipt of a message from the physical layer to pass the received message to the upper layer.
![[Pasted image 20230417092320.png]]

#### Management service
The management services of the MAC layer include functionalities for *PAN initialization, devices association/disassociation, detection of existing PANs* and other services exploiting some of the features of the MAC layer. 
The main management services are summarized in **Table** : in the table symbol $X$ in a cell corresponding to **service** $S$ and **primitive** $P$ denotes that $S$ uses the primitive $P$, while symbol $O$ means that primitive $P$ is optional for the **RFDs**.
![[Pasted image 20230417092611.png]]
Let' describe the **ASSOCIATE** service: this service is invoekd by a device wishing to associate with a PAN which it have already identified by preliminary invoking the **SCAN** service. The `ASSOCIATE.request` primitive takes as parameters (*among others*) the *PAN Identifier, the coordinator address, the 64-bit extended IEEE address* of the device.
The primitive sends an association trquest message to a coordinator (*either PAN coordinator or a router*): since the association procedure is meant for **beacon-enabled networks**, the association request message is sent during the **CAP period** using *slotted CSMA-CA Protocol*. 
![[Pasted image 20230417092900.png]]
The coordinator **acknowledges immediately** the reception of the association messages, however this *acknowledgement does not mean that the request has been accepted*.

On the **coordinator side** the association request message is passed to the upper layers of the coordinator protocol stack (*using the `ASSOCIATE.indication` primitive*) where the decision about the association request is actually taken. 
If the request is accepted the coordinator selects a **short 16 bit address** that the device may use later in place of the **64-bit extended IEEE address**. 
The **upper layers** of the coordinator thus invoke the `ASSOCIATE.response` primitive of the coordinator MAC layer: this primitive takes as parameters the 64 bit address of the device, the new 16 bit short address and the status of the request (*which can be association successful or an error code*). The primitive thus generates an association response command message which is sent to the device requesting association using **indirect transmission**, *i.e., the command message is added to the list of pending messages stored on the coordinator*.

The **MAC layer** of the device automatically issues a *data request message* to the coordinator after a pre-defined period following the acknowledgement of the association request command. The coordinator then sends the association response command message to the device.
Upon receiving the command message, the devices’ MAC layer issues a `ASSOCIATE.confirm` primitive, while the MAC layer of the coordinator issues the `COMM-STATUS.Indication` primitive to inform the upper layer that the association protocol is concluded either with success or with an error code.

### MAC layer security
The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layers provides a basic support for security, and it leaves advanced security features (*such as keys management and device authentication*) to the upper layers. All the security services are based on symmetric-keys and use keys provided by the higher layers. 
The MAC layer security services also assume that the keys are *generated, transmitted, and stored by the upper layers* in a secure manner. Note also that the security features of the MAC layer are optional and the applications can decide when and which functionality they use. The security services provided by the MAC layer are the following:
- **Access control**: allows a device to keep a list of devices (called the Access Control List, or ACL) with which it is enabled to communicate. If this service is activated, each device in the PAN maintains its own ACL and it discards all the incoming packets received from devices not included in the ACL. 
- **Data encryption**: uses symmetric cryptography to protect data from being read by parties without the cryptographic key. The key can be shared by a group of devices (typically stored as the default key) or it can be shared between two peers (stored in an individual ACL entry). Data encryption may be provided on data, command, and beacon payloads. 
- **Frame integrity**: uses an integrity code to protect data from being modified by parties without the cryptographic key and to assure that the data comes from a device with the cryptographic key. As in the data encryption service the key can be shared by a group or by pairs of devices. Integrity may be provided on data, beacon and command frames.
- **Sequential freshness**: orders the sequence of input frames to ensure that an input frame is more recent than the last received frame.

# Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a *cable replacement technology* for PC, Mobile phone and specific purpose devices. It have a *limited coverage* up to 10 meters and can support *variable speed* transmission (*based on the specific protocol version*). 
Bluetooth allows to implement a *personal area network* with lower costs and lower power comsuption respect to IEEE 802.11. 
The major version releases (*`x.1`*) happened in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2016.  Other versions have been released over the years up to get to 2010 when version 4.0 was released which it introduced a distinction between the modes of use:
• *Classic Bluetooth*
• *Bluetooth High Speed*
• *Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)*, this in particular is the standard which was thought to conflict with Zigbee. It is used on devices that have very low power and therefore it's optimal to manage sensors and simple actuators.

The overall architecture is pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230417094845.png]]

There is a separation between the **controllers** (*more than one controller is possible*) and the **host**: lower layers are part of the controller and are usually implemented at hardware level (*in a single chip*), while the upper layers (*from L2CAP*) are part of the host despite *L2CAP* itself can be on chip. Overall, the layers on *L2CAP* can be considered as *application layers*.
The lower layers (*green one*) are responsible for:
- **Radio**: defines the specification of the radio frequencies. 
- **Baseband**: defines the low level procedures of the PHY layer 
- **LMP (link management protocol – for BR/EDR) / LLP (link layer protocol – for BLE)**: setup and control of the link (*see following sections)*. 
- **HCI (Host Controller Interface)**: interface between hardware and software. 
- **L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation)**: manage *higher-level protocol multiplexing, packet segmentation and reassembly*, and the conveying of quality of service information. It provides an **interface to higher level protocols** and applications to transmit and receive data packets, up to $64$ kilobytes in length and implements *flow control and retransmission modes*.
- **SDP**: Service Discovery Protocol

### Bluetooth BR/EDR
The protocol operates at $2.4 GHz$ and guarantees a transmission rate of $1Mbps$ as **Basic Rate (BR)**, up to $3 Mbps$ for **Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)**. Those type of devices can form a ***Piconet***:it's a group of devices syncrhonized to a common clock and frequency hopping pattern, coordinated by a device inside the same group. Usually are possible only small piconets composed of 8 devices. The Bluetooth BR/EDR is a **connection oriented** protocol: when a device is connected, the link is mantained even if there is no data flow. The idea of Bluetooth is that starting with a **single physical link** we can create one or more logical links that are used to carry *synchronous, asynchronous and isonchronous data*.
The power consumption can be reduced if the devices are in **sniff mode**: this allows the device to sleep thus saving months of battery life. The transmission usually happen at $25mA$ so it's necessary to support the communication but not all type of communication require the same power so specific cases must be taken into account like coin cell battery. 

### Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)
Bluetooth LE is optimized for ultra low power consumption: short packets allows to reduce *TX peak current* and RX time, alongside with a less coice of channels to imporve the discoverymechanism and connection time (*supporting also the connectionless communciations)*. This result in a simpler state machine respect to BR/EDR.    
The LE standard consider also the *coin cell battery cases*, implementing the transmission with a less than $20mA$ peak current and an average current consumption under $5 \mu A$.
As before, LE operates at $2.4 GHz$ but with a transmission rate up to *1 Mbps*: the protocol is designed to send **small chunks** of data so it's intended only for *exposing state purposes* and not for long data transmission (*e.g. file transmission*). The parameter to be optimized, on which the LE focus, is the *power consumption* and not the data throughput.

On **physical channel side**, LE uses a *Frequency division multiple access (FDMA)* over $40$ physical channels with *Time division multiple access (TDMA)*: this result in having 3 channels ($37,38,39$) reserved for **connection, discovery and broadcast**. Each physical channel is divided into time units (events) that can be **Advertising events** or **Connection events**. 
LE standard operates in a range of 150 meters, does not support multi-hop network and it's a **connectionless protocol** that allows to support a huge number of devices (*up to 2 billions*).
![[Pasted image 20230417102229.png]]

### Network Topology
The devices don't all have the same role, they are **Master** and **Slave**, so we can implement two topologies, one is **point to point** with a connection between master and slave
and one is **point to multipoint** with one master being connected to many slaves.
Within the networks we create ***piconets*** which are groups of devices that are connected to each other, especially one is the master and the others are slaves and all communication is with the star topology.

Here an example of *Piconet* in *Bluetooth BR/EDR*: 
![[Pasted image 20230417102652.png]]
We have several piconets all living together in the same area: in the example we have $A$ which is the master for two different piconets (*blue and red*). The $E$ node it's a slave for both $A$ and $F$. Then we have another piconet in which $D$ is the master and $J$ is the slave, in this case the $D$ is the master in a piconet and slave in another. 
In general **we can connect different piconets** in this way with a device that acts as a gate in the two piconets.
We then have a device which is $K$ which is not in any piconet and which he's just using the channel to find a piconet.

In the following image is pictued a Piconet for Bluetooth LE: 
![[Pasted image 20230417103119.png]]
We have a piconet with master $A$ and two slaves which are $B$ and $C$, then we have a piconet with master $F$ and $G$ as slaves.
Then we also have nodes that can communicate without forming a piconet, it is the case of $D$ which occasionally sends its internal state and does not form a piconet, but $A$ receives the state of $D$ and therefore makes one sort of scanner. 
The same thing also happens in the case of $E$ and $C$ with $C$ acting as a scanner and $E$ acting as an advertiser.
Another interesting thing is that here we have devices that don't
participate in a piconet, $H$, $J$ and $I$ but are able to
listen to each other.
