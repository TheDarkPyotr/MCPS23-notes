**How to keep internet connectivity while trying to improve the lifetime of the battery by reducing the duty cycle of the Radio.**
Taking off the radio, there's no network. Risk to not receiving packets from the network. Important to study **Mac protocols that focus on the energy efficiency, not performance of the network**.
## Design guidlines

Find a tradeoff between the latency and the bandwith vs the energy usage. If you turn off the radio from time to time, if you have to send a packet **this will be delayed till the radio is up again**, so you lose in latency and bandwith.
Three approaches:
1) Explicit synchronization of nodes, doing extra work on the nodes to ensure that there's **no collision and gives the possibility to devices to turn off their radio**. (S-MAC, IEEE 802.15.4)
2) Preamble sampling protocols, use a synchronization that is **implicit** of the protocol. Simple but not adopted. (B-MAc)
3) Polling, asymmetric protocol. Devices **are not equivalent**, **there are devices that spends more energy because they focus on synchornizing the other devices.** (IEEE 802.15.4)

## Synchronization of the nodes:
![[Pasted image 20230404154824.png]]
If the devices are time synchronized, **they can agree on when to turn off the radios.** In that period of "offline", there will be no comunication, so no packet are lost. Duty cycles sync on all the nodes of the network. We are trading **latency here**.
The problem of this approach is how we choose the duty cycle, but another problem is on multi-hop network. (!= star)
![[Pasted image 20230404155050.png]]
As we see that the basestation/gateway (in this case is a router too) **is connected to a small amount of devices in the network**, some devices are being used as routers to comunicate with the external gateway. The problem of sync becomes complicated, **each hop introduces additional delay due to the processing and transmission time of each node. This can make packets lose because they were sent in the inactive time**.

#### S-MAC (For Multi hop networks)
![[Pasted image 20230404161055.png]]
**MAC level protocol.** It is a network organization protocol because it makes an explcit synchronization protocol, it performs local organization. Nodes alternate listen/sleep period, reduce duty cycle.
![[Pasted image 20230404161323.png]]
It's not possibile that the agreement between two adjacent nodes be true for all the network. **Adjacent node can synch between each other.** (**Local not global**). Sync frames to schedule the sleep and the wakeup. The first time that the device wakes up, the first thing is to listen to the channel to find other nodes **that already has an active period and sleep period scheduled, no need to agree on a new one**. If  i don't hear anyone around, this don't mean that there's no network, probably they are too far away. As far as im concerned, im **alone, so i will decide my own active and inactive time after it broadcast a SYNC frame that tells the other nodes its time of activity**. If my schedule is not shared by anyone, throw it and take another one, **ensure that schedules that are not shared will be removed.**

3) Node X may need to turn on its radio also outside its listen period. **This means that if node X needs to send a frame to node Y outside of Y's listen period, it will need to turn on its radio even if it's not its own listen period**

**Initial Schedule, X and Z has two different duty cycles**:
![[Pasted image 20230404163409.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230404163427.png]]
Y will chose one of the two, the majority of your neighbours.
![[Pasted image 20230404163510.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230404163537.png]]
As you see **Y turns on her radio to transmit to Z in her listen time**. Again LOCAL synch, **X and Z don't share the same schedule**.
![[Pasted image 20230404163641.png]]
We could have problem of collision, if X and Y has the same listen time, they will send packets on the same time and this creates a collision. By putting the radio on, you could intercept comunications that are on, so you need to wait until it ends, but this can create problems with the listen time. **Adaptive duty cycle fix this** by basically "**if you hear and RTS or CTS you keep your radio on until the end of the transmission just in case it is the next hop of the comunication.**"
Energy consumption of 10% duty cycle over the radio is huge in S-MAC.

Tradeoff between latency and sync. The nodes that are not synchronized increases the latency, **because they have to wait to send the frame until the other node is in listen mode.** 
![[Pasted image 20230404165743.png]]
From A to C you comunicate within 1 activity period, But you have to wait for D, E and F. Latency added on D,E and F.
Bigger duty cycle, lower latency but higher energy consumption.

![[Pasted image 20230404170002.png]]
1) For low power and cheap devices, the time is calculated in a poor way, you have a drift on the clock.
2) Synchronization of the activity periods can be hard to achieve becuase of the topology of the network. Neighbor chose schedules that are different.

## B-MAC Implicit synchronization
![[Pasted image 20230404170405.png]]
Same as S-MAC for the type of network: **Multi hop networks.**
**No explicit node sync.** A sender might transmit whenever it wants, not taking into account the listen time of the others.
In reality you don't transmit the data frame as the first frame, but a long preamble frame that tells the other nodes that you will soon enough transmit a frame.
**The receiver activate the radio, sense the channel, if there's no preamble, turn off the radio. If you find the preamble, then wait for the data frame, at the end of the preamble.**

![[Pasted image 20230404171908.png]]
The sender spends more energy because of the send of the preamble, the receiver will have lower energy usage.
![[Pasted image 20230404172542.png]]
preamble should be longer than the listen period. **The length of the listen period is typically determined based on the specific requirements of the application, not by the protocol itself.**
