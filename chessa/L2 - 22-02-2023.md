In Iot we can have **latency** and **reliability** issues: this happens because the physical devices can be (and they are) far from each other, this without any doubt adds latency to the iot network. With reliability we mean the process of the network to lose nodes or packets due to some type of **failure/incident**. We saw 2 approaches:
**1) Everything is on the Cloud:** 
This means that all the processing is done in the cloud, the devices at the perception level are meant only to acquire data and send it to the cloud servers, where all the processing is done. Here latency impacts a lot, since the amount of data sent to the cloud can be huge.

**2) Some Processing on the Edge**: 
We can adopt some perception devices (still sensors) with a little bit of computational power (small cpu) to process some of the input data, in this way we can reduce the amount of packets sent to the Cloud servers. It's not mandatory to use the cloud, if your devices can make all the processing alone, then you don't need any cloud.

Let's see what some terms means:
![[Pasted image 20230222212922.png]]
1)**Edge**: the edge of a typical enterprise network is a network of IoT-enabled devices consisting of sensors and perhaps actuators, these devices may comunicate with one another. A cluseter of sensors can comunicate with a central device that aggregate the data to be collected by a higher level entity. A **gateway** interconnects the Iot devices with the higher level comunication networks, it performs the traslation between the protocols used in the comunication networks (on top of **perception** layer) and those used by devices.
Perception layer uses some protocol that needs to be translated to enter the network. In **Poche Parole** in the edge we find the **physical** devices of the perception layer.
2)**Fog**: It's an infrastructure of local servers and access points, connected together to provide fast response time to the  **edge** **devices** and to reduce the amount of data that goes to the cloud, typically the fog devices are deployed **physically near the edge**. So rather than storing data **permanently** or for **long period** in a central storage we do as much processing as possibile on the **Fog** level. Processing elements at these levels may deal with high volumes of data and perform data transformation operations, resulting in the storage of much lower volumes of data.
Examples: **Evaluation**, **Formatting**, **Expanding** / **decoding**, **Distillation** / **reduction**, **Assessment**.
You can think of Fog as the opposite of Cloud:
**Cloud: centralized storage and processing for a relatively small number of users 
Fog: distributed processing and storage resources close to the massive number of IoT devices**
3)**Core**: the core **network connects far fog networks and provides access to other networks.** The core network uses high-performance routers, high-capacity transmission lines and multiple interconnected routers for redundancy and capacity. It may connect to other type of devices, such as high performance servers and databases or private cloud capabilities. **This means that you can connect fog networks to the cloud.**

## The AI approach to IOT

AI aims at getting computers to behave in a smarter manner, **either through curated knowledge or through machine learning**.
**Curated Knowledge:**
![[Pasted image 20230222192441.png]]

**Machine learning**:
Subfield of AI that deals with automatic systems that can learn from data. The system is fed by examples to learn to associate input with output, then when an input (**never seen**) is given, the model/system produces anyway an output. If **well trained** the output will mostly be correct, due to generalization capability of ML.
**3** **ML PARADIGMS**:
**Unsupervised learning**: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is presented with a dataset and must find structure or relationships within that dataset on its own. The goal is to identify underlying patterns or groupings within the data. **Without any type of labeled data**.

**The following 2 are used in IoT**:
**Supervised learning**:  learn from past examples, **every example is a pair input + desired output**, aims at predicting the future or interpret the present.
**Reinforcement learning**: learn from examples, **but the main difference is that the example is a pair input + reward**, in this way the system knows that the answer is correct if there's a reward. E.g. to learn a game the reward can be +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 otherwise.

## IoT and emerging Paradigms
**Blockchain** is a **shared and trusted public ledger** for making transactions, everyone can inspect and nobody can alter it. the blockchain thus provides a single point of truth: it is shared and **tamper-evident**, in case of tampering it's quickly noticed.
Blockchains shifts the IoT paradigm from **centralized storage** to a **decentralized one** in a distribuited ledger. Supports the expanding of the Iot Ecosystem. Since the **ledger is public** this implies a **reduce in maintenance costs** and provides trust in data produced. An implementation of this approach can be seen on having different companies that work in a supply chain, everyone of them needs to **check the quality of the product** along the chain. Each company in supply chain can **query the ledger** and check the latest transaction, thanks to **smart contracts** that are used to certify each intermediate transaction. 

## Interoperability & Reference Standards
A straight implementation of an IoT solution is not a problem by itself, you can design the solution from the bottom (Physical layer) up to the application layer. This approach is called **Vertical Silos** (No external comunication, tutto quello che fa parte dell'infrastruttura è interno al silos) since this system only has your devices and every change/update requires **your intervention**. This creates a **Vendor Lock-in** for your clients because the silos prevents them to use devices from other vendors (Wii con crossfit, altri sono riusciti a crearlo e venderlo a prezzo più basso). Vendor lock-in forces high costs to **migrate** to another vendor, customer need to fully redesign and deploy a new solution.
**Standards** are useful to fix this problem. The first standards we saw are for **Wireless technologies**:
![[Pasted image 20230223102134.png]]
1)**IEE 802.11** aka **WIFI**: is a **family of standards** useful for networks where devices are close to each other (Range = 100 meters) but need high data rate. There's a new standard IEEE 802.11A, B, AC. They added new features such as additional frequency bands (5GHz). Since Wi-Fi networks operate on specific frequency bands, with this band the network is faster and less congested. **Increasead trasmission range and bit rate.** Another useful feature is Roaming between access points, this means that a device changes to the nearest access point in the network.

2)**IEEE 802.15.4 and Zigbee**: is a wireless communication standard for low-rate wireless networks, where devices are very close to each other (low range). It defines **both physical and MAC layers**. Usually used when developing low-power sensor networks. Low power = Low throughput (115 Kbps, molto poco) and low duty cycle (percentage of time sensor is sensig). Thanks to the fact that Zigbee network can create a **mesh topology**, we can create larger range networks. In partial mesh topology, nodes basically forward the data to the desired node, in this way the network can grow.

3)**Bluetooth**: Higher data rate than ZigBee, but the range is basically the same. Used to make multimedia comunication. Small networks with **master-slave comiunication**, master sends the data and the slave acquire it.

**Why standards?**
Usually motivated by a reduction of the costs for development of a technology, the price for a new technology is high but as soon as other companies try to create the same one this will **instantly drop the price**. For instance think about a technology that has been developed on the lower layers, in this case comunication layer (Wifi) the companies can move to higher layers in order to create their own technology and sell it at their price.(a quel livello non si guadagna più).
**Coopetition**  can be a good approach for companies, they work with eachother to develop a standard but still deploy their own technologies, built on top of those standards. **Usually happens when technology becomes mature,the big revenues are somewhere else.** As said before, this happened for wireless comunications, we saw lot of different standards. **Interoperability problems moved to the higher layers**.
