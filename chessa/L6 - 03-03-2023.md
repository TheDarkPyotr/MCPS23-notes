### MQTT ISO/OSI protocol stack
![[Pasted image 20230303163018.png]]
##### CONNECT
A client connects to a broker by sending a `CONNECT` message. This enstaurate a TC connection with the broker. The CONNECT Messages contains:
- *Client ID*: it's an optional identifier, if absent is setted to 1.  It's necessary in case of persistent connection: allows to restore connection even in case the connection with the broker is broken, allowing to restore the session from the last *time* the exchange of the message happened. Using no client ID implicit declare the *no session state* so this setting the *Clean Session* flah to true. 
- *Clean Session (Optional)*: it's FALSE if the client request a persistent session.
- *Username/Password (optional)*: No encryption unless used with SSL
- *Will flags (optional)*: allows in case of disconnection ungracefully to sent a **last will message** to the subscribers by the broker (*in case of broken connection with the broker and/or damage*).
- *KeepAlive (optional)*: the broker expect to receive from the client periodic message of alive. If not received, the broker can assume that the client is dead and close the TCP connection (*possibly sending the last will message to each subscriber*). The `KeepAlive = 0` turn of this mechanism, indicating that the subscriber will never send the alive messages to the broker. 

The broker acknoledges to the CONNECT message with the CONNECTACK message that states if the connection is accepted or rejected and also informs the client (in case of persistent session) information about the previous session.

### PUBLISH
Each message contains a **topic** and a **payload** of whatever type because its managed as a bunch of bytes. Only the subscriber is able to understand the semantics of the payload.

The publish message is sent by the publisher to the broker and forgetted. Then it's forwarded by the broker to the subscriber.
The `PUBLISH` message contains the following data:
- `packetId`: an integer, is 0 if the QoS level is 0
- `topicName`:a string possibly structured in a hierarchy wih slash **/** delimeters
- `qos`: 0,1 or 2 (*see later*)
- `payload`: the actual message in any form (*usually interpreted as bytes*)
- `retainFlag`: tell if the message is to be stored by the broker as the last knoen value for the topic. If a subscriber connects later, it will get this message
- `dupFlag`: indicates that the message is duplicate of a previous un-ACKed message. This field is meaningful only if the `qos` is greather than 0.
![[Pasted image 20230303165056.png]]
The `retainFlag` allows to send a specific message for later subscriber: store it to the broker. 

When the **broke**r receives a `PUBLISH` message, it: 
- acknowledges the message (*if requested, QoS>0*) 
- processes the message (*identify its subscribers*) 
- delivers the message to its subscribers 
The **publisher**:  
- leaves the message to the broker 
- does not know whether there are any subscribers and whether or when they will receive the message

#### SUBSCRIBE
There can be a difference of QoS between publisher and broker vs subscriber and broker: even in case of 3 different subscriber with different QoS, the broker will manage them independently.
The structure of the `SUBSCRIBE` message is the following:
- `packetId`: an integer
- `topic1`: a string (*as in publish message*)
- `qos1`: 0,1 or 2
Usually a `SUBSCRIBE` message contains a list of `(topic, qos)` because a subscribe message can refer to multiple topics with the relative QoS.

The **broker** acknowledges the subscriber with a `SUBACK` message. It contains the following fields:
- `packetId`: the same integer of the relative `SUBSCRIBE` message
- `returnCode`: one for each topic subscribed. The value `128` indicates failures (*e.g. the subscriber is not allowed or the topic is malformed*) while `0,1,2` indicates success with the corresponding QoS granted (*that can be lesser than the QoS requested*). 

#### UNSUBSCRIBE
A client can unsubscribe a topic to stop receiving the related messages. The `UNSUBSCRIBE` message is composed by:
-  `packetId`
- `topic1` 
- `topic2`
- `topic_n`
The `UNSUBACK` message: 
- `packetId`: the same of the `UNSUBSCRIBE` message


### Topics
Topics are strings that are organized into a hierarchy: each level is separated by a **/** *slash*.
The subscriber can use **wildcards** to specify a group of topics:
- `home/firstfloor/+/presence`: select all presence sensors in all rooms of the first floor
- `home/firstfloor/#`: select all sensors in the first floor
If using only a dash as a topic, you will subscribe to all topics, including the reserver one.
Topics that begins with **"$"** are reserved for internal statistics of MQTT so they cannot be published by clients. An HiveMQ example:
```bash
$SYS/broker/clients/connected $SYS/broker/clients/disconnected $SYS/broker/clients/total 
$SYS/broker/messages/sent 
$SYS/broker/uptime
```

Topics must do not contain sace, are short for memory storage optimization and packet size, use ASCII char UTF-8. It's also common practice to embed the clientID in topic or an *unique identifier* like `sensor1/temperature` so that onlt the client with the same `clientID` can publish such a topic. 

## Quality of Service
The QoS is an agreement between the send and the receiver of a message: the underlying TCP allows the QoS to gurantee delivery and ordering of the messages.
In MQTT the QoS is an agreement between the *clients (publishers/subscribers)* and the *broker*.
MQTT define three levels of QoS:
- **At most once (`level 0`)**
- **At least once (`level 1`)**
- **Exactly once (`level 2`)**
So QoS is used both between publisher and broker and between broker and subscriber.

###### At most once (`qos: 0`)
It's called *best effort* delivery because messages are not acknoledge by the receiver. When used between publisher and broker messages are not stored by the broker and immediately forwarded.
It provised the same guarantees as the TCP Protocol: it guarantees delivery as long as the connection remains. If one of the two peers disconnect there's not guarantee anymore.

###### At least once (`qos: 1`)
Messages are numbered and stored by the broker until they are delivered to all subscribers with QoS level 1. Each message is delivered at least once to the subscribers with QoS 1. A message may be delivered more than once so it's suitable when the subscribers can handle the management of duplicated messages.
Subscribers send acknowledgements by sending `PUBACK` packets.

###### Exactly once (`qos: 2`)
It's the slowest mechanism to guarantee QoS because check that each message is received exactly once by the recipient. It uses a **double two-way handshake** by sending `PUBLISH` and the relative ACK by the `PUBREC` Packet. Respectively, the client send `PUBREL` to acknoledge the reception of the message: the broker now can drop the message from its storage and declare the transmission complete by sending a `PUBCOMP` packet.
So for each message of QoS level 2 there is need four times the exchange of packets required by the level 0.
To summarize QoS level 2 exchange:
![[Pasted image 20230304093804.png]]
The **broker**: 
1. receives the PUBLISH with a message 
2. Process the PUBLISH 
3. Sends back a PUBREC 
4. Keeps a reference to the message until it receives PUBREL 
The **client**: 
1. Sends PUBLISH with a message 
2. Waits for PUBREC and then store PUBREC and discards the message 
3. Sends back a PUBREL to inform the broker 
4. Waits for PUBCOMP and then discards the PUBREC

The *double two-way handshake* is necessary because the first handshake allows to send the message, the second is to agree to discard the state. The `PUBREC` message alone is not sufficient because if it's lost, the client will send again the message so the broker needs to keep a reference to the message to identify duplicates. With `PUBCOMP` the broker known that it can discard the state associated to the message. 
This level of QoS is suitable when the clients *cannot manage duplicates* so the complexity to guarantee avoiding duplicates is managed by the broker that keep tracks of ACK and stores messages, with high overhead.

## Persistent sessions
Persistent sessions keep the state between the client and the broker: if a subscriber disconnect, when it connects again, it does not need to subscribe again the topics. The session is associated with the `clientId` defined with the `CONNECT` message. 
In a persistent session the data stored are:
- All subscriptions to topics
- All QoS `1,2` messages that are not confirmed yet
- All QoS `1,2` messages that arrived when the client was offline
A persistent session is requested at `CONNECT` time (*`cleanSession` flag setted to FALSE*): the `CONNACK` message confirms whether the session is persistent.
Also clients have to **store state** in persistent session:
- Store all messages in QoS `1,2` flow, not ACKED By the broker
- All received QoS `2` messages not confirmed by the broker
Messages of persistent sessions will be stored as long as the system allows it. The persistent mechanism can be avoided when refers to publishing-only clients that uses onlt QoS level 0 or if old messages are not important or when miss some data is not a problematic. 

## Retained messages
A publisher has to gurantee that its messages are actually delivered to the subscriber, even for later subscriber. When a client connects to the broker and subscrbes a topic, it does not known when it will get any message. For each topic, we can have **only one retained messages**, generally the *last one message* sent by the publisher. This way a new subscriber is immediately updated with the *state of the art*.
A retained message is a normal message with the flag `retainFlag` setted to TRUE: the message is stored by the broker so if a new retained message is published, the broker will keep the last one received. 
When a *client* subscribes the topic of the retained message, the broker immediately sends the retained message for that topic: this can also works combined with **wildcards**.

The mechanism of **retained messages** and **persistent sessions** are completely decoupled: the second are messages kept by the server even if they had already been delivered. To delete a retained message is sufficient to publish a retained **empty** message of the same topic. This mechanism is usefull for *unfrequent updates* of a topic: for *example*, consider a device that update its status (`ON/OFF`) on topic `home/devices/device1/status` so if it publish ON, this status will remain for long time and if the message if retained, all subscribers will easily know the device is on. 

## Last will and testament
Last will and testament feature is used to **notify other clients about the ungraceful disconnection of a client**. At `CONNECT` tune, a client can request the broker a specific behavior about its last will: it's a normal message with `topic, retainFlag, QoS` and `payload` stored by the broker as a last will.
When the broker detects the client is **abruptly disconnected**, it ends the last will message to all subscribers of the topic specific in the last will message. If the client send `DISCONNECT`, the stored last will message is discarded because the underlying assumption is that before correctly disconnect the clients has been already notified other clients.
So, the broker sends a last will message if:
- Occurs an IO Network error
- The client does not send the `KeepAlive` message in time
- The client closes the network connection without sending `DISCONNECT`
- The broker closes the connection with the client because of a protocol error

The last will is specified in the `CONNECT` Message and contains 4 optional fields:
- `lastWillTopic`: a topic
- `lastWillQoS`: either 0,1,2
- `lastWillMessage`: a string
- `lastWillRetain`: a boolean flag
-
The last will message can be combined with **retained messages**: imagine a scenario in which a devices updates the status (`ON/OFF`) on topic `home/devices/device1/status` so it's powered and publish `ON` with a *retained message*. If the device crashes and then it abruptly disconnect, it does not publishes `OFF`: *last wll message* can be useful here because could be a retained message with payload `OFF` so the **subscribers and the futues ones are properly informed**, even in case of unwanted disconnection. 

### KeepAlive
The KeepAlive mechanism assure that a client and its connection with the broker is still **alive**: the client sends periodics messages to the broker that prove its liveness. The *frequency* of these messages is declared in the `CONNECT` message. The keep alive message must be sent by the client before the connection expiration of the interval set with the CONNECT message. 
![[Pasted image 20230304101151.png]]
**KeepAlive** timer (*managed by the broker to control the liveness*) is resetted by both `PINGREQ` messages and by pulbish a message on a topic: this allows to be consired alive by the broker. So if the client does not send `PINGREQ` in time or any other message, the broker turns off the TCP connection and sends the last will message.

## Packet format
The structure of an MQTT **control packet** is the following:
![[Pasted image 20230304101920.png]]
The **fixed header** is composed by **2 bytes**, the first contains:
![[Pasted image 20230304101933.png]]
- *MQTT Control packet type*: 4 bit (*range 7 to 4*)
- *Flags specific to each MQTT control packet type*: 4 bit (*range 3 to 0*) 
The second byte contains the **remaining length** which is the **length** of the variable header and payload: 7 bits are used to encode the remaining length while one bit (*the MSB, index 7*) is a flag that specifies that there is another field. 

The **control packet type** are:
![[Pasted image 20230304102050.png]]
The **variable header** contains the `packetId` (*encoded with 2 bytes)*, only the packets regarding the `CONNECT` and `CONNACK` does not contains the `packetId` while the `PUBLISH` Ppacket contains this information only if `qos > 0`. It can contains other information depending on the control packet type: for example, `CONNECT` packets include the protocol name and version, plus a number of flags (*see CONNECT)*.* 
The **payload** can be empty or, in case of `CONNECT` message it contains data about the client or for `PUBLISH` can be optional (*empty payload are allowed, e.g. to reset retained message*). For example, for `CONNECT` Packet includs:
- client identifier (mandatory) 
- will topic (optional) 
- will message (optional) 
- Username (optional)  
- Password (optional)
In the following table is listed when the payload is required:
