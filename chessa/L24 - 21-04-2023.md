# Energy Harvesting
Energy harvesting comes to a wide range of topics like *energy haversting Iot architecture, properties of the energy source, battery and load and energy neutrality.*

The IoT device that we consider are battery-powered (*either rechargable or changeable*). The battery life can be increased, for example by enlarging batteries despite it is come with major costs. 
Another point of view is to extends device lifetime but reducing the computational ability and limited communications. 
Those two are the main pathways to prolong the battery life: both can be applied.
The decisions regarding the battery are done at the begginign while the duty cycle structure can be *modified*, by making it *with a dynamic behavior*: adapting the DC can prolong the lifetime, by respecting the device functional requirements.

The alternative is give by **energy harvesting** which consists in converting energy from one from to another.  The source of energy can have different properties (*periodic, non-predictable, etc*): after identifying the source, the tradeoff between how acquiring it physically and the effective utilization in the device must be designed.

The energy harvesting implies also a complex design of the device, allowing to parametize more features of the device.

The **energy source** is the source to be harvested while the **harvestng source** is the technology used to extact energy from the environment. In most of the cases this sources have a not controllable behavior so the device's harvesting source must take the behavior into account. 
The **load** is the consumption of energy in a device due to its activities: it varies over time based on the specific activities the device is executing at a time. 
Overall, an **Harvesting system** is a system that supports a variable load from a variable energy harvesting source. It allows to power the device even in a period when the energy source does not provide energy by storing it. 
To match energy supply and load, two main approaches are used:
1. **Energy buffer**: as a rechargeable battery or a supercapacitor
2. **Adapting load**: align the workload to the actual energy supply, implying also reducing functions

Neither of these approaches may be sufficient because the *load* cannot be reduced arbitrarly (*having a dynamic DC it's a complex task to perform*) and the *buffer* one it's not the ideal solution because there is no *infinite storage* and must be also considered *energy leaks*. 


## Harvesting architectures
In a simplified scenario, we have two components:

There are problems to be addressed: the device can be **abruptly turned off** and the state management of internal state of the device must be addressed, exploiting the energy to mantain consistency and resume operation later. Another issue is that the energy supply can be the bare minimum, oscillating between the threshold to work properly.

### Direct harvesting model
In this scenario no energy buffer are provided to store energy thus the excess supply is *wasted*: the power produced immediately is consumed so, referring the following diagram, the device can operate anytime at time $t$ when:
$P_{s}(t) \geq P_{c}(t)$
where:
- $P_{s}(t)$ is the **power harvested** at time $t$
- $P_{c}(t)$ is the **power consumption on the load** at time $t$
The *waste of energy* is given by the following conditions:
- whenever $P_{s}(t) < P_{c}(t)$: the device is turned *off* due to insufficient energy
- whenever $P_{s}(t) > P_{c}(t) : P_{s}(t)-P_{c}(t)$ is in excess

### Energy buffer model
Another model is **with energy buffer**: with this model, in principle, the device can work anytime but the reality is different. 
![[Pasted image 20230424163729.png]]
In this model the energy is harvested whenever possible and stored for future use. The *residual energy* is tored and it is used later when either there are no harvesting opportunities or the device task require more energy.

The problem is that no exists an **ideal energy buffer** that can *store any amount of energy, does leak energy over time, has a decresing charging efficiency $\mu = 1$* that in the real world is below 1. 
The device can operate any time if, for every time interval $(0,T]$:
$\[ \int_{0}^{T} P_{c}(t)dt \leq \int_{0}^{T} P_{s}(t)dt + B_{0} \,dx \]$
where $B_{0}$ is the initial charge of the *ideal supply*.
The integral express the **amount of energy the device has consumed** (*consume power multiplied by time*), the same is for the energy supply.

This model does not consider the point previously cited about the ideal energy buffer like *energy leaks and charging efficiency*.
The following diagram picture the *energy storing* using the previous model:
![[Pasted image 20230421171802.png]]
As shown, we can compute how much power we are using from the buffer: this is done only for values of $x$ (*or the difference in the integral*) over 0. 

### Non-ideal energy buffer model
This model still refer to **ideal buffers**. Differently, *real-world* buffers are defined by those parameters:
- $B_{max}$: maximum battery capacity (*energy buffer size*)
- $B_{t}$: battery charge at time $t$ 
- $P_{leak}(t)$: be the leakage power of the battery at a time $t$
- $\mu < 1$: the charging efficiency of the battery
- $P_{s}(t)$: power harvested at time $t$
- $P_{c}(t)$: load at time $t$
- $B_{0}$:initial charge of the buffer
- **Rectifier function**:$\begin{equation}
    x^{+} =
    \begin{cases*}
      x & if $x > 0$ \\
      \0        & x \leq 0
    \end{cases*}
  \end{equation}$

The energy conservation leads to the following equation $\forall T \in (0,\infty]$:$B_{t} = B_{0}+\mu \int_{0}^{T} [P_{s}(t) - P_{c}(t)]^{+}dt - \int_{0}^{T} [P_{c}(t) - P_{s}(t)]^{+}dt - \int_{0}^{T} P_{leak}(t)dt \geq 0$ where:
- The first integral accounts for the **energy produced in excess** (*thus not consumed*) that goes to buffer
- The second accounts for the **energy consumed* from the buffer** (*when the production was insufficient*)
- The last integral accounts for **buffer energy leak**

In the previous model, what is still missing is the *buffer limit*: isnecessary to guarantee that the buffer capacity is not exceeded or, better, to guarantee that there is no *wasted energy*. This can be formalized as by imposing that $\forall T \in (0,\infty]$, the value of $B_{max}$ is:$B_{max} \geq B_{0}+\mu \int_{0}^{T} [P_{s}(t) - P_{c}(t)]^{+}dt - \int_{0}^{T} [P_{c}(t) - P_{s}(t)]^{+}dt - \int_{0}^{T} P_{leak}(t)dt$

### Exercise
Consider an *harvest-store-use* device with a **non-ideal energy buffer**:
- In the interval $[0, 10sec]$ the energy production is constant and produces $P_{s}(t) = 80 mA$ 
- In the interval $[0, 4sec]$ the load is $P_{c}(t) = 150 mA$
- In the interval $[4sec, 10sec]$ the load is $P_{c}(t) = 20 mA$
- The charging efficiency is $\mu = 95\%$
- The battery charge at time $0$ is $400 mAh$ 
- The energy leak of the battery is negligible
Compute the battery charge at times $4sec$ and $10sec$.
