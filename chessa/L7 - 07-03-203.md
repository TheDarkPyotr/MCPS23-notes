Main topic of this lecture is **ZigBee**. 

# MQTT on Arduino

Include only a subset of MQTT specific, excluding:
- No SSL/TLS
- QS levlw 2
- Payload limited to `128` bytes

#### Constructors
- `PubSubClient()`
- `PubSubClient (server, port, [callback], client, [stream])`: create a fully configured client instace. The API includes other *PubSubClient* with lesser parameter. The parameters are:
	- Server address: IP address of the broker (*as an `IPAddress` object*)
	- Port: port used by the broker. Because SSL/TLS is absent, usually is the 1883.
	- Callback: a pointer to a function that allows to distinguish between subscriber, publisher or both. They are implemented on top of interrupts and allows to intercept publishing/invokation.
	- Client: an instance of the `Client` class that cna connect to a specified internet IP address and `portCLlient` (*e.g `EthernetClient`*)
	- Stream: an instance of `Stream`, used to store received messages (*e.g. `mqtt_stream`*)

#### Functions
- `boolean connect(clientId, username, password, willTopic, willQoS, willRetain, willMessage)`: connect the client, specifyng the **will message**, username and password (*as basic authentication mechanism*)
- `void disconnect`
- `int publish(topic, payload, length, retained)`: publishes a message to the specified topic, with the **retained flag** as specified. Return `FALSE` if publish fails, either due to connecion lost or message too long, while return `TRUE` if publish succeeds. The API includes other `publish()` with lesser methods.
- `boolean subscribe (topic, [qos])`: topic is a `const char []`, payload is a `byte[]`, length is `byte`, retained is `boolean` and qos is an `int`. 
- `boolean unsubscribe(topic)`:
- `boolean loop()`: to support the keepAlive features 
- `int connected()`: check whether the client is connected to the server
- `int state()`: return the current state of the client
 The following function configure the parameter to the server if still not initialized by the constructor:
 - `PubSubClient setServer (server, port)
 - `PubSubClient setCallback (callback)
 - `PubSubClient setClient (client)
 - `PubSubClient setStream (stream)

## MQTT Competitors 

HTTP is a valid alternative to MQTT, despite it's not speficially designed to operate for IoT devices at appliaiton level. 
![[Pasted image 20230307112648.png]]
HTTP used in IoT device can be used in two different ways:
1. Clients are server and accept accept connection from services
2. Service is the server and accept incoming connection from clients (devices)
This paradigm poses problems on scalability, also considering the size of messages and the focus of communication (*because HTTP is not suitable for constraned devices*).
In real world application both solution are deployed (*e.g. TeamSpeak, AWS IoT*) because nowadays devices are not entirely constrained on power/computation capacity.

There are several **limitations** on MQTT: the need for a centralized broker can be limiting in scenario wher we have several point-to-point communication because the overhead of a broker may easily become not compatible with end devices capabilities as the network scales up. Also, the broker is a **single point of failure** and the underlying TCP protocol does not come for free: it's not cheap for low end devices. Exists also an MQTT based on UDP, not standardized nowadays.

## Brief CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)

Standardized in RFC-7252, it's specialized for **web transfer** and it's suitable for machine-to-machine for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks. It used under the hood the UDP Protocol. 
![[Pasted image 20230307113500.png]]

CoAP also support a direct conenction between devices, without relying on an intermediate bridges to translate/support the communication.

CoAP is designed to work with nodes with *8 microcontrollers* with small amounts of ROM and RAM.  Constrained networks such as IPv6 over 6LoWPANs: it concerns the size of the header, compressing addresses and header used in IPv6. 
The main strenghts are:
- Native UDP
- Multicast
- Security embedded in the specification
- Asyncrhonous communication
While, the weaks are:
- Standard maturity
- Message reliability noy quite sophisticated, similar to MQTT QoS

# ZigBee 
It covers almost all layer from phyisical to application layer. It's a stamdard for wireless sensors and actuators networks: it's considered an IOT standard even if use TCP/IP as its internal mechanism. 
The protocol is developed and promoted by industrial private alliance called ZigBee alliance.

It covers different application cases like *home automation, health care, consumer and industrial automation*. It's a competing standard with Bluetooth, especially in eHealth environment where ZigBee failed but had more successfull application in other sectors.

The main requirements that drove the designing of the protocol were:
- Network completely autonomous, self-organiziting with minimal or nothing manual intervention
- Very long battery life: ideally a ZigBee device should last 10 years
- Low data rate: allows to guarantee a very long battery life by optimizing performances. This allows trading performances for battery life.
- Interoperability of ZigBee devices from different vendors

This criteria result in some main features, like:
- Standard based
- Low cost
- Can be used globally: it's complex to guarantee because in the range of private frequencies, there is a limit of power. This constraints are country-specific but almost all countries have a subset of frequencies in common.
- Reliable and self-healing
- Support large number of nodes: up to 30.000 devices that using short range (200m) communication. For larger distances there is the need to introduce *multi hops networks*.
- Easy to deploy (by definition)
- Very long battery life
- Secure embedded

Despite is not mentioned, the *transport layer* features are implemented by some sub-layers between network and MAC layer.

#### IEEE 801.15.4 Standard
Define the specification of the physical and MAC ayers for low rate PAN. It operates on top of the frequencies of WiFi and Bluetooth: using the same frequencies but not perceived or talk each other, just consider each other as *noise*. The frequency that are defined by the specification are:
- 868–868.6 MHz (e.g., Europe) with a data rate of 20 kbps; 
- 902–928 MHz (e.g., North America) with a data rate of 40 kbps; or 
- 2400–2483.5 MHz (worldwide) with a data rate of 250 kbps

## ZigBee Standard
![[Pasted image 20230307162949.png]]
The Application layer of ZigBee is defined by 3 sub-layer:
1. Application Framework: contains ip to 240 **Application Objects (APO)** in which each APO is a user defined ZigBee application.
2. ZigBee Device Object (ZDO): provides services to let the APOs organize into a distributed application. Guarantee interoperability between different devices of different vendors
3. Application Support sublayer (APS): provides data and managemnt services to the APOs and ZDO.

### Service primitives
Each layer provides its data and magement service to the upper layer so **each service** is specified by a set of primitives of four generic types.
Between all the services and all the layer, only **4 primitives** are used/consumed between each layer:
- **Request**: It is invoked by the upper layer to request for a specific service;
- **Indication**: It is generated by the lower layer and is directed to the upper layer to notify the occurrence of an event related to a specific service; 
- **Response**: It is invoked by the upper layer to complete a procedure previously initiated by an indication primitive;  
- **Confirm**: It is generated by the lower layer and is directed to the upper layer to convey the results of one or more associated previous service requests.
Services may not use all the four primitive (*see later*). 
![[Pasted image 20230307163527.png | 600]]

Here an example of *service primitives* that allows to visualize the flow: same levels of different nodes interact by means of those 4 primitives. 
![[Pasted image 20230307163642.png]]


#### Data trasnfer
The data transfer between node assume an uniform name called **Data Unit**, encapsulated at different level with different packet layers, here specified:
![[Pasted image 20230307163743.png | 600]]
For each layer:
- *Application Protocol Data Unit*
- *Network Protocol Data Unit*
- MAC Protocol Data Unit
- *Physical Protocol Data Unit*

## Network Layer
At network level we identify 3 types of devices:
1. **Network coordinator**: Despite been a infrastructurless protocol, a coordinator have the function of create the network by taking decisions/interfacing with the rest of the network. Allows to bootstrap the network.
2. **Router**: provide routing features in a large network and can also have services capability. From the point of view of routing capabilities, they have the same capabilities or coordinator.
3. **End device**: they are not able to communicate alone with the rest of the network and use coordinators/routers to communicate. They must be attach to the coordinator to be able to communcate over the network. They do not need to implement the entire standrd, differently from router/coordinators that must have the capabilities to implement the standard fully. Generally they correspond to a RFD or FFD with simple features (***RFD***: *Reduced Functional Interface*, ***FFD***: *Full Functional Device*)


We can have different **network topologies** like:
![[Pasted image 20230307164039.png | 725]]


In a **star shaped topology**, the router have the same roles as end device: they uses the *superframe*. In the **tree topology**, the *multi-hop network* (*not fully addressed in those notes*) functionalities are supported and the nodes can communicate only via the intermediary routers: they can or cannot use *superframes*. In **mesh networks**, the communication is possible even between nodes witout relying on the *superframe infrastructure* *. #todo --> lectures in IEEE 801.15.4 on CSMA/CA.

The network layer provides services for:
1. Data transmission (both unicast & multicast) 
2. Network initialization 
3. Devices addressing 
4. Routes management & routing 
5. *Management of joins/leaves of devices*: because the networks is formed incrementally, formed a network with an arbitrary topology.

Here a table that summarizes which services uses the 4 primitives already mentioned:
![[Pasted image 20230307165435.png | 700]]
As highlight the table, not all four primitives are used in the listed operations: particularly, the `GET` and `SET` are functionalities used **locally to set/get parameters of the network layer**, internally, without using communication means.

Before communicating over a network, a ZigBee must either:
1. Form a network so it's a **ZigBee coordinator**
2. Join an existing network so it's a **ZigBee router/end-device**
The role of the device is chosen at **compile-time** by specifing the code ad application level when writing the **Application Object** code.
