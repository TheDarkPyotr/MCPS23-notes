### Exercise 2
Consider the sensor specification in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230328161140.png]]

The device measures the hearth-rate (HR) of a person: 
- Samples a photo-diode on the wrist at 20 Hz 
	- sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms 
	- it requires both the processor and the sensor active 
- HR is computed every 2 s (based on 40 samples) 
- Transmit (from time to time… see below) a data packet to the server: 
	- The average time required to transit is 2 ms 
	- Requires both processor and radio active
Compute the energy consumption and the lifetime of the device if it sends all the samples to a server: 
- Stores 5 consecutive samples from the photodiode 
- Transmits the stored 5 samples to the server 
- The server computes HR (hence the device does not compute HR)
Disregard battery leaks.


#### Solution 2
**Duty cycle of sampling**: DC of processor + sensors: 0.5 milliseconds (sampling time) / 0.05 seconds  = (sampling period)= 0.01

**Duty cycle of transmitting**: DC of radio + processor: 2 milliseconds (transmit time) / 0,25 seconds (transmission period) = 0.008

Sensor power consumption: 
	$E_{\mu} = 5 mAh * 0,01+ 5 uAh *0,99 =0,05+0,005 mAh = 0,055 mAh$
Processor power consumption:
	$E_{\rho}=0,018*8 mAh + 0,982*15 uAh =0,144+0,0147 mAh = 0,1587 mAh$
Radio power compsution:
	$E_{\lambda}=0,008*20 mA + 0,99992*20\mu A = 0.16 mA + 0.0198 mA = 0.1799 mAh$

$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\lambda}$ 
Battery specification (*in table*) $B_{0} = 2000mAh$
Power consumption: $2000 mAh / 0,3935 mAh$     $(\frac{B_{0}}{E})$
	obtaining **Lifetime**:  $5082 h$

The period of sampling is a strict reqirement (20 Hz): sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms and require both the processor and the sensor active.
The HR is computed every 2s (based on 40 samples)

### Exercise 3
Consider the sensor specification in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230328162514.png]]
The device measures the hearth-rate (HR) of a person: 
- Samples a photodiode on the wrist at 20 Hz
	- sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms 
	- it requires both the processor and the sensor active 
- HR is computed every 2 s (based on 40 samples)
	- Computing HR in the device takes 5 ms 
- Transmit a data packet to the server: 
	- The average time required to transmit is 2 ms 
	- Requires both processor and radio active
Compute the energy consumption and the lifetime of the device if it computes HR itself:
- Transmits every 5 values of HR computed (1 packet every 10 seconds)
Disregard battery leaks

### Solution 3
 Duty cycle of sampling:    0,5 milliseconds (sampling time) / 0,05 seconds (sampling period)= 0,01
- Duty cycle of processing: 5 milliseconds / 2 seconds = 0,0025 
- Duty cycle of transmitting: 2 milliseconds (transmit time) / 10 seconds (transmission period) = 0,0002

- Power consumption of sensor (in 1h): 
	- $E_{\mu} = 5 mAh * 0,01+ 5 uAh *0,99 =0,05+0,005 mAh = 0,055 mAh$
- Power consumption of processor (1h): 
	- $E_{\rho} = 8 mAh * 0,0127+ 15 uAh *0,9873 =0,1016+0,0148 mAh = 0,1164 mAh$
- Power consumtpion of radio (1h): 
	- $E_{\theta} = 0,0002 *20mAh + 0,9998 *20uAh = 0,004 + 0,02 mAh = 0,024 mAh$

		$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\theta}$ = $0.1954 mAh$
Battery specification (*in table*) $B_{0} = 2000mAh$
Power consumption: $2000 mAh / 0,1954 mAh$     $(\frac{B_{0}}{E})$
- Lifetime: $2000 mAh / 0,1954 mAh = 10.235 h$

## Exercise 4

Consider a Mote-class sensor with the parameters in the table.
![[Pasted image 20230328174646.png]]

Assume that the device performs a sensing task with the following parameters:
- The sensor board is activated with a rate of 0,1 Hz to perform the sampling; this operation takes 0.5 milliseconds. At the end the sensor board is put in sleep mode. During each sensing operation the processor is always active. 
- After each sampling the processor performs a computation that takes 2 milliseconds. 
- Then the processor activates the radio and transmits the data. The transmission takes 1 millisecond and, during it, the processor is active. At the end the radio and the processor are both set in sleep mode. 
Compute the duty cycle of each component (*sensor board, radio and processor*), and the lifetime of the device (*assuming that the sensor stops working when its battery charge becomes 0*).

#### Solution 4
- Sampling takes $0.5 ms$ with a rate of $0,1 Hz$ 
- Processing: $2 ms$ 
- Transmitting: 1 ms
- **Duty cycle of sampling (processor and sensors)**: $0.5 ms /10s = 0,00005$ 
- **Duty cycle of processing (only processor)**: $2ms/10s$  $(10000ms) = 0.0002$  
- **Duty cycle of transmissions (radio&processor)**: $1ms/10s  = 0.0001$

- Power consumption of sensor (in 1h): 
	- $E_{\mu} = 5 mA * 0,00005+ 0,005 mA * (1-0,00005) = 2.5*10^{-4} mA + 0.05 mA = 0.00525 mA$
- Power consumption of processor (1h): 
	- $E_{\rho} = 8 mA * 0.00035 + 0,015 mA *(1-0.00035) = 0.0028 mA+0,015 mA = 0,0178 mAh$
- Power consumtpion of radio (1h): 
	- $E_{\theta} = 0,0001 * 1mA + (1-0,0001) *0,02 mA = 100 nA + 20 \mu A = 0.0201 mA$

		$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\theta}$ = $0.04315 mAh$
Battery specification (*in table*) $B_{0} = 2000mAh$
Power consumption: $2000 mAh / 0.04315 mAh$     $(\frac{B_{0}}{E})$
- **Lifetime**: $2000 mAh / 0,04315 mAh = 46.349 h$



Duration of activity/period=3.5 ms / 10 seconds

*note: period is 1/frequency=1/0.1=10 sec

$dc\_idle * 0,015 mAh + dc\_active * 8 mAh=$
$=(1-0.00035)*0.015 + 0.00035*8 mAh=$
$=0,01499 + 0.0028 mAh = 0.0178 mAh$

Lifetime = capacity/consumption per hour = $2000/0.043 mAh$
