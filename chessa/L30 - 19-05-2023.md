# Wireless Sensor Network
The sink nodes act as a output gateway to the outside networks. Based on specific sensor purposes, they sample the environmental parameters, producing a **stream of data** that can be pre-processed locally and then forwarded to the *sink* node.
![[Pasted image 20230522162020.png]]
The sink node can also be temporary unavailable thus the network must operates autonomously by pre-processing and storing sensed data (*by logging partially of fully the data stream produced, considering also simple aggregation methods*).
To optmize the overall mechanism, **data aggregation** can be performed by the all the nodes by coordinating themself to avoid energy consumption and optimize memory storage among the network's nodes.

The deployment of this type of networks is easy due to an *absence of cabling* and the feature offered by the devies to **self-configure themself** without manual intervention.

The main differences respect to *ad-hoc networks* (*a type of wireless decentralized network*) are that in *WSN* there can be an higher number of nodes and sensors are *strongly constrained* in power, computational capacities and memory.  Due to the higher number of nodes, sensors networks are denser and are prone to failures.

This kind of network poses also the problem of routing data from internal node to the sink and then outside the network, considering the device's constraints in term of resources. 


## Data centric vs node centric
The main problem is to obtain information to route information to the specific devices and services.

The association between the address of a device and its physical location must follow an approach that allows to **derive one from another**, allowing to simplify the routing process.

We can distinguish two main approches for network organization and communication between nodes:
 - **Node centric**: the communication is mostly based on node addresses or identifier rather than the content it store or can provide to other nodes
 - **Data centric**: the communication and node-to-node interaction is based on the node content. This behavior involves using a *query* or *subscription* communication model that involves identify a set of attributes of interest  and notify the other nodes when a certain type of data to which some node expressed interet is produced/received.
 

The second paradigm, considering the network perspective, involves the source node that transmit data of interest for the destination node that expressed interest by broadcasting a query: some of the data will travel along the same path of another transmitted data. These data will travel independetly along the same path: to optmize the transmission it's possible to perform **data aggregation** to efficient the transmission (*e.g. in image this happen in 4 different points*).


For the example pictured above, we are interested in stream of data produced by nodes that respect the condition $temperature < 5$: the node $5$ perform aggregation because is closer to node $2$ and $4$, alongside node $8$ perform eggregation for the data received first from node $1$ and $2$ and then from the node $4$. (*We explicitly mixed up temperature with node identifier, refer the image to get the overall point of the schema*). 

![[Pasted image 20230522190051.png]]
The specific requested query can be based on the **location** and not only based on a data condition, unrelated to the location:  even in this case IP addresses and network adresses does not solve entirely the problem. The data-oriented communication process can also allows to identify different area based on common condition that implicitly produced data respect.

Differently from internet, the underlying devices are not full-resources devices and thus does not support a layer only for discovering data based on keyword, for example (*as internet decouples addressing using DNS from the searching based on keyword using search engines*).


#### Implosion and overlap issues
The data-centric mechanism supported by the *query* communciation model, alongside with an overall absence of reliability mechanism for data transmission can lead to an *overflow* of packets towards network's nodes.
Two main problem can arise from the presented scenario:
- **Implosion**: caused by the *flooding-based dissemination* of the data among nodes. In the figure, node $A$ tart by flooding its data to all of its neighbors ant two copies of data eventually arrive at node $D$. This implies wasting resources for additional send/receive operation by the nodes. 
- **Overlap**: two sensors cover an overlapping geographic region so the sensors flood their data to neighbor's node but node $D$ receives two copies of the data market $r$. This scenario requires suitable *data identification and aggregation algorithms*. 
![[Pasted image 20230522191229.png]]


The implosion problem can be solved by applying some form of internal or network identification.

The overlap problem regards the *range of action of a sensor*: despite been placed in a fixed point, it also sense noise and accessory part, commonly shared by two different sensors.
This poses the problem of differentiate between two different event that activate a sensor or a single event that is in the overlap area of two different sensor.


## Directed Diffusion
**Direct Diffusion** is a *datacentric* protocol for WSN: basically it specify how organize the network addresses that simplify the routing operations. The data genered by sensors are named by *attribute-value pairs* so nodes requests data by sending interests for named data.

Allows to instruct the device on the fly by send a specific parametric request to the sink node, allowing to specialize or generalize a given *query*.
The specific query can be posed as human-like questions: the sink broadcast (*or disseminate*) a packet to the entire network, specifying the parameters for all the device.
The protocol and the main components involved can be identified in 4 steps:
1.  *Interest-Based Communication*: the communication is based on **interests** expressed by sink nodes. Sink nodes indicate their interest in specific types of data or attributes by issuing **interest queries** to the network. These queries specify the data they want to receive.
2.  *Gradient-Based Data Propagation*: Once a sensor node receives an interest query, it begins to **propagate** the data towards the sink node using a **gradient-based approach**. Each sensor node maintains a *local gradient* or preference for a specific data type. The **gradient** represents the desirability of the data and *guides the data propagation process (see later)*.
3.  *Data Collection and Reinforcement*: As the data flows towards the sink node, intermediate sensor nodes **collect and aggregate the data**. They use the information to refine their local gradients, reinforcing paths that are more efficient in delivering desired data types.
4.  *Feedback-Based Adaptation*: Directed Diffusion incorporates *feedback mechanisms* to adapt the data *dissemination process*. Sink nodes provide feedback to sensor nodes by reinforcing or suppressing data flows based on their needs and quality requirements. This feedback helps optimize the routing paths and enhances energy efficiency in the network.

### Interest query
Interest queries are periodically generated by the sink: usually the first query of a given type is **exploratory** while the next broadcast are **refreshes** of the interest. This refresh is necessary because dissemination of interest is not realiable.
Nodes that receives an interest query may forward  the interest selectively to a subset of neighbors.

Nodes usually caches the received interest query:
- Interests that differ only for *sampling rate* are aggregated
- Interests inc ache expire when the duration time expires
Each interest in cache has a **gradient** which expresses:
- a **direction**: thhe node from which the interesrt was received, used to route back to the sink node
- a **data rate**
The same interest may be received from different nodes hence relevant data may be sent along several gradients, following multiple paths.
![[Pasted image 20230522171354.png]]

Example of a simple animal tracking task (*or interest query*):
```python
type = four-legged animal // detect animal location
interval = 20 ms // send back events every 20 ms
duration = 10 seconds // .. for the next 10 seconds
region = [-100, 100, 200, 400] // from sensors within rectangle
```
The data sent in response to the interest is also named using a similar naming scheme:
```python
type = four-legged animal // type of animal seen
instance = elephant // instance of this type
location = [125, 220] // node location
intensity = 0.6  // signal amplitude
confidence = 0.85  // confidence in the match
timestamp = 01:20:40  // event generation time
```

The `interval` field specify the sampling rate and the rate at which the information must be transmitted. This allows to determine the duty cycle of the device but also the transmission rate between the devices alongisde the path to the sink for transmission purpose.


### State machine
When a sensor detects an *event* amtching with an interest in cache, it start sampling the event at the large *sampling rate* of the corresponding *gradients*. Then it sends sampled events through the gradients associated to the given interest in cache: these gradients correspond to the *neighbors interest in the event*, so dat through a gradient flow with the *rate* of that gradient.

Sampling does not stop **routing functionality**: this is possible because the state machine is implemented on *interrupt* thus to have a device act as a router and sensor by means of of **abastracting thread** (*as used in TinyOS*).

In the diagram: (*forward interest; (to neighbors)*)


The data propagation mechanism implicitly ensures reliability by duplicating the data for each path indicated by the gradient but this kind of reliability is not controllable, as shown here:
![[Pasted image 20230522174654.png]]



### Reinforcement
The reinforcement process allows to enhance the quality of received data. Sppose to have a sink hat receives data that match a certain interest query from a given sensor $n$. The sink can *reinforce* $n$ by incrementing the sampling rate along a given path, making the data propagation along a specific path thus making sure that only that specific route can survive among others directed to the node $n$.
The reinforcement behavior is usually subsequent to the first *exploratory request*, correlated to *refresh requests*. 
Here are pictured an example of *reinfrocement process* result:

#### Scalability, pros and cons 
It's very scalable because the data to be stored are mainly the **gradient data structure** that grows with the number of node in the network. Surely, hundreds of devices cannot be in the same transmission range, it's optimal to have a low density number of devices on the same range.

It's suitable for application tha sense data but not require complex data aggregation or preprocessing. For complex event (*e.g. explosion*), the charaterization of the event must be done by *multiple sensors*, not only one. 
The data processing to identify that a given event happened can also be done outside the network, by transmitting the data and process it or it can be done in network by increase the **point-to-point exchange** of data between the internal nodes.
Remember that transmit 1 bit correspond to process 1k of data: the ideal would be to push the computing power more locally to the devices, as the *fog and edge computing* mechanism try to deliver for cloud and data center solutions. 

#### Directed Acyclic Graph Scalability
We mentioned varioust ime that a *tree-based network organization* allows to enhance scalability performances.
Differently, for this scenario consider to have a network composed as a grid of nodes with two different sink, respectively located as *top-right* and *bottom-left* nodes, as pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230522180206.png]]

The nodes alongside the matrix border must carry out the burden of forwarding the data to the respective sink, also consume more energy respect to periferic nodes: to solve the problem we can introduce more sink nodes but overall the nodes in the range of a sink will still have an high burden of transmitting data to this nodes.
This special type of network topoology does not allows to process in a balanced way the data inside the network itself.

Even considering an arbitrary connected network with two sink nodes (*in the same position as before*), as pictured below, the nodes closer to the sinks still represent a *bottleneck* for the overall network, consuming more in term of energy and managing the burden load of the network. 
![[Pasted image 20230522180801.png]]
In the previous image, darker nodes denotes larger power consumption.

The experimental results presented in ["Coordinated and controlled mobility of multiple sinks for maximizing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11276-010-0313-8) for **data colelction strategies** shows that a *grid network deployment* with five sink nodes, one at the center and four at the corners, can ease the load on the nodes closer to the sink nodes.
![[Pasted image 20230522181333.png]]



#### Drawbacks
When considering the event sampling of an entire WSN we can think also for *complex events* that is detected only by an high number of sensors in a very sparse geographic area. 
![[Pasted image 20230522182050.png]]
The task in the previous figure implies the necessity of performing data pre-processing: if we work with images, the *input bandwidth* it's much higher respect to output because the pre-processing allows resize the information that can be extracted from a image sensing activity. Overall, the differences between input and output in the table would suggest when can be computationally advantageous to pre-process data directly on the sensor itself.
