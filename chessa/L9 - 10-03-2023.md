##### Network Formation
The *network formation* is initiated by the `NETWORK-FORMATION.request` primitive: it's invoked by a device that acts as a **coordinator** and that is not already in another PAN. 
The operation uses the MAC layer services to **look for a channel** that doe snot conflict with other existing networks: it **selects a PAN identifier** which is not alredy in use by other PANs.

1. At application layer is invoked the `NETWORK-FORMATION.request`
2. The network layer execute an *energy scan* to verify if there is noisy on the channel
3. The MAC layer return the result of the energy scan: at this point, the network layer request a second scan, differently from the first because it's an **actve scan** to lookup nearest PAN networks. This is due to avoid to have two different PAN with the same identifier so a preventive scan allows to select a PAN ID unique among the already existing. 
4. The MAC Layer return a list of existing PAN ID and the Network Layer now can set the PAN ID.

Now the Network later can configure the MAC Layer starting from the time the `START.request` is sent and the MAC Layer can start to send beacon frames. After that, the MAC layer can answer with a `START.confirm` that will be translated also by the network layer with a `NETWORK-CONFIRMATION.confirm`  to the application layer to confirm that the PAN has been created.

To **join** inside a PAN network there are two ways:
1. The end-device or the router can communicate with the coordinator to request the access: this method is called **Join Through Association**
2. The coordinator request a device to join the network: this method is called **Direct Join**

#### Join through association (`CHILD-SIDE`)
![[Pasted image 20230311121914.png | 600]]

The device that wish to join a PAN:
1. Performs a `NETWORK-DISCOVERY` to look for existing PANs
2. Select a PAN
3. Invokes `JOIN.request` with parameters like the *PAN Identifier* of the slected network, a *flag* indicating whether it joins as a router or as an end device. This request in the *network layer* selects a "*parent node `P`*" (*in the PAN*) from its neighbourhood. In a **star topology** `P` is the coordinator and the device join as end-device, while in a **tree topology** `P` is the coordinator or a router and the device can join as a router or as an end-device. 
4. The association protocol obtains from `P` a $16-bit$ **short address**: the `ASSOCIATE.confirm` returns to the netowkr layer the short address that will be used in any further communication over the network. 
The `JOIN.request` is triggered at application level: this require preliminarly to scan the network to find a free channel to communicate. The scan is perfomed troguht `NETWORK-DISCOVERY` which return a list of PAN network to connect: this allows to select the PAN and send the `JOIN` request. 
Depending on network topology, the association of a new device can be structured by identified implicitly a **root father** so the topology assume the form of a sort of a tree: the end-devices will be the leaves while the internal nodes are the router, the *coordinator* is the root node. This tree-structure topology is used to assign the addresses to new devices, coordinated by the *ZigBee coordinator* that decides and control parameters like *number of leaves, number of routers, depth of the tree* and so on. Each router have assigned its own set of addresses to assign to new joined devices: the assignment of the address is performed by ensuring that new devices are highest in the network and are at a lower number of hops from the root/parent router. 


## Application Layer
The application layer comprends various components:
![[Pasted image 20230311122809.png]]
1. **Application Framework**: contains up to 240 **Application Objects (APO)** in which each APO is a user defined ZigBee application.
2. **ZigBee Device Object (ZDO)**: provides services to let the APOs organize into a distributed application. Guarantee interoperability between different devices of different vendors
3. **Application Support sublayer (APS)**: provides data and managemnt services to the APOs and ZDO.
 
#### 1. Application Framework
The application framework can contains up to 240 different *Appication Object (APO)*, each one uniquely identified inside the netowrk. 
Simplest APO can be queried with *Key Value Pair data service (KVP)* by using primitives like `Set/Get/Event` transactions on the APOs attributes: native KVP disappeared in the second version of ZigBee but itâ€™s now present in the cluster library.
Complex APO can have conpelx states and communicate with the *Message data Service*. Here an example of complex APO:

![[Pasted image 20230311123327.png]]
We have two devices, the first with two endpoint, the second with three endpoint: the logic of this device can be easily implemented using two `ON-OFF` attribute and two endpoint in the device A.
**APOs 5B, 6B, and 8B** have a single attribute containing the status of the bulbs (on/off) that is configured as servers at the application layer while **APO 10** and **APO 25** are switches, and they are configured as clients at the application layer. The attributes of **APOs 5B, 6B**, and **8B** can be set remotely from the **APOs 10A** and  **APO 25A**. 

#### 2. Application Support Sublayer (APS)
The APS define the **endpoint, cluster, profile IDs and device IDs**. It's responsible for:
- Data service (*light transport layer*) that provides support for the communication's reliability and packet filtering
- Management services which includes mantaining a local binding table, a local group table and a local addresss map. 

The **endpoints** are identified by a number between 1 and 240: an endpoint can be seen as the equivalent of a Unix socket, connecting virtual wires to applications. 
The **cluster** is a protocol that can be used to implement the functionality of a given application: cluster defines the attribute that contains the information about the APO. A cluster is defined by an identifier of ***16 bit***, local inside the **profile**. In ZigBee a **profile** defines a set of application layer protocols that enable interoperability between devices that perform specific functions or serve specific purposes. A profile specifies the standard ways in which devices should communicate and exchange information, making it easier for devices from different manufacturers to work together.

A profile consists of one or more **clusters**, which are groups of related functionality that can be supported by a device. Each cluster is identified by a unique ***cluster ID**, which is a 16-bit integer value.

A cluster defines a specific set of messages and commands that devices can use to communicate with each other. *For example, the ZigBee Home Automation profile includes clusters for controlling lights, thermostats, and door locks. Each cluster specifies the data format and message types that devices should use to exchange information related to that functionality.*
![[Pasted image 20230311124737.png]]
In the previous table, the *Basic Cluster* with ID `0x0000` allows to retrieve basic information about the device, the *Power Configuration Cluster* allows to set the *minimum and the maximum temperature* of the device. Also, the *OnOff Cluster* allows to set the *switch* ON or OFF, as expected.  

The *APS **Device IDs*** range from `0x0000` to `0xFFFF`: this value has two main purposes:
1. To alows human readable displays (*e.g. an icon is realted to a device*)
2. Allows ZigBee toools to be effective also for humans:
	1. A device may implement the on/off cluster but you don't know whether it's a bulb or a oven so you only kwno you can turn it on or off. The DeviceID tells you what it is, but it does not tell you how you can communciat ewith it: this is given by the IDs of the cluste rit implements.
ZigBee discovers services in a network based on profile IDs and cluster IDs, but not on device IDs because each device is specified by the combination of Application profile and cluster ID.
Here example of device IDs:
![[Pasted image 20230311161838.png]]


The *APS ***Services*** provides data service to both APOs and ZDO: allows to ***bind a service to the ZDO*** and ***group management services*** (*see later)*. APS data service enables the exchange of messages between two or more devices within the network: the data is defined in terms of primitiviles like `request(send), confirm(return status of trasnmission), indication(receive). `

The reliability of a data service is ensured by using the **ACKNOWLEDGE messages** for data trasmission:
![[Pasted image 20230311162150.png]]

The *APS ***Group Management*** provides service to build and mantains groups of APOs: a group is identified by a $16-bit$ address and each APO in the group is identified by the pair network *address/endpoint*. The `ADD-GROUP` primitive allows to add an APO to a group and `REMOVE-GROUP` primitive to remove an APO from a group: takes group number and endpoint number; if the group does not exists it's created. The nformation about groups are stored in a *group table* in APSs.

##### APS Binding
The binding operation allows an endpoint on a node to be conncted (*bound*) to one or more endpoints on another nodes: the binding is **unidirectional** and can be configued only by te ZDO of the coordinator or of a router. So the binding provide a way to specify the destination address of the messages: this method is called **Indirect Addressing**.
When a Message is routed to the destination APO based on its pairs `<destination endpoint, destination network address>` the method is usually called **Direct Addressing**. Direct addressing might be unsuitable for extremely simple devices while *Indirect addressing* exploit the ***Binding table***. 

Two main primitives are used for binding, respectively `BIND` and `UNBIND`:
1. `BIND.request` creates a new entry in the local binding table. It takes in input the tuble `<source address, source endpoint, cluster identifier, destination address, destinatione endpoint>`
2. `UNBIND.request` deletes an entry from the local binding table

In the **Indirect addressing**, the binding table matches the *source address `<network addr, endpoint addr>`* and the *cluster identifier* into the pair `<destination endpoint, destination network address>`. The binding table is stored in the APS of the ZigBee cordinator and/or of the other router: it's updated on explicit request of the ZDO in the routers on in the coordinator. It's usually initialised at the network deployment. 

In the scenario of light bulb and a switch, can be complex from the switch side to know to which light bulb connect but, this information is kwnown by the installer. Despite operating directly on the device, the installer can set and entry in the **coordinator's binding table** so that the messages arriving to the switch will be forwarded to the light bulb. 

Here an example of **binding table** with a request `APS-DATA.req` of cluster 6 from EP 5 on node `0x3232` that in **indirect routing** will generate 4 data requests:
- Node `0x1234`, endpoint `12`
- Multicast to group `0x9999`
- Node `0x5678`, endpoint `44`

![[Pasted image 20230311163416.png]]
In the preceding binding table, the `Src Addr` and the `Dest Addr` are formatted as a MAC address: this choice has been made because the devices can disconnect/re-connect to the network for many reasons, requiring a reconfiguration of the addresses in the binding table. 
The column `Addr/Grp` allows to tag as destination a group of devices (`G`). Also, the same devices can be the source of dirrent messages (`Src EP = Endpoint`). 

The *APS **Address Map*** allows to associated the $16-bit$ network address with the $64-bit$ IEEE MAC address: ZigBee end devices (*ZED*) may chabge their 16 bit network address when they leave and join again. In that case, ana nnouncement is sent on the network and every node updates its internal table to preserve the binding.
