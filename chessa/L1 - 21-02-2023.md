## Introduction to MCPS
#### Smart Environment
There is no universal accepted definition. According to Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environment:
*“smart environments can be defined with a variety of different characteristics based on the applications they serve, **their interaction models with humans**, the practical system design aspects, as well as the multi-faceted conceptual and algorithmic considerations that would enable them to operate **seamlessly** and **unobtrusively**”*

They are considered smart for the final user because can **recognize context, situations and activities**, **able to figure out use need at right time** and **provide services**. They also have in common several characteristic like **persasive**, **unobtrusive cyber-physical devices**. 

For Iot or **Internet of Things** we mean physical objects embedded with electronics, software and sensor, with **network connectivity**. Generally, they are objects with **sensors** and **actuators**: they respectively represent the two flow of data in-and-out of the IoT system because **sensors** can receive input data and elaborate them by resulting in a performed physical action on the physical environment by **actuators**. 

#### IoT Devices
Each IoT devices is composed by 4 main components:
- **Sensors/actuators
- **Microcontroller
- **Wireless interface**
- **Software for business logic**
We can identify in IoT a *layered architecture*:

**Sensors** at **perception layer** can be  of different type based on the nature of activity that need to be carried out:
- Specific: they're a fully-functional component and not need to be istantiate along other components to accomplish the desiderated task
- Aspecific: they're part of a chain of interaction with other component and this interaction (*e.g. Camera that effect facial recognition task*) allows to perform the intended task

#### Platforms for IoT
Sensors and actuators are the edge of the cloud: behind internet, data is stored, processed and presented in the cloud. So **IoT Platforms** provide software layer between IoT devices and applications. Their functionalities may be distributed between devices themselv, gateways and server in the cloud or at the edge.
Those platform not allow only data collection but can perform several complex functionalities with a various range of activities (*as mentioned, facial recognition can be a service offered/performed via AWS SageMaker connected to AWS IoT*). 
Those platforms allows a wide range of functionalities:
- **Identification**: provides a unique way to identify things in the platform. There are several established standard, based on context:
	- *IP Address*: for Internet
	- *MSISDN – Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number*: for telephony identification
	- *URI - Universal Resource Identifier*: on resources exposed to web
	- *UUID - Universally Unique Identifier*: in computer system and bluetooth-based communication system
- **Discovery**: 
	- A mean to find devices, resource and/or services within an IoT deployment inside the same network of devices. This allows also to obtain properties, features and services and locate via identification. 
- **Device Management**: as *initial setting* allows to pair, secure setting and key distribution, manage configuration and binding of devices with services, calibrate the sensors, localize devices etc. Managing involves also **Automatic Software Updates** (*both for software and firmware*), **device real-time monitoring** (*battery level, internal tempeture, energy consumption*), **diagnostic/default detection**, **remote control of devices** (*by activate pheriperals and remote rebooting, without human interaction*) and **system logging and audit management**.
   Clearly there are different standard based on a given context. The most popular are:
	- **OMA DM (Open Mobile Alliance Device Management)**: mainly for management activity of mobile terminals
	- **OMA LWM2M (Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight Machine2Machine**: used for management of IoT devices
	- **BBF (Broadband Forum) TR-069**: management for end-users appliances (*e.g. DSL terminals, etc.**)
- **Abstraction/Virtualization**: an IoT device is seen as a service so the physical device is associated with its *digital twin*. This provide a way to represent IoT devices and their context, enabling a broad of function on the virtual-device like reasoning and AI-processing over data.
- **Service Composition**: build a composite service by integrating services of different IoT devices and SW components.

Based on the previous layered architecture model, we add the details just mentioned and provide a general picture on how those are distributed among the layers:

### NoSQL databases
No-SQL databases are used in big data and real-time application: they're suitable to scale on horizontal cluster of machines. 

As main example, we use **MongoDB**: what in SQL were *Records* in MongoDB are **documents**. Documents have a *JSON*-like data syntax: in the following snippet, they're all *field:value* entry. 

```json
{ 
	name: “sue”, 
	 age: 26, 
	 status: “X”; 
	 group: [“news”, “sport”] 
 }
```

A set of *name/value* pairs are separated by commas: a `value` can also be an array.
So MongoDB **documents** correspond to **native data types** in many programming languages: can embed other documents and arrays to reduce the need for expensive joins. 

What were **tables** in SQL, in *MongoDB* are **collections**: documents can be grouped in collection but, differently from SQL, different documents in the same collection can have different structure. 

#### Queries
Usually a **query** targets a specific **collection**: it specify criteria and conditions that identify a set of documents in the collection. As SQL, a query can also include a *projection* that specifies the fields to return or include modifier of the output (*like sorting of result, manipulating data format, etc*).  Here an example:

```json
db.sensedData.find({time:{$gt: 1900}}).sort({time:1})
```

which is represented by the following image:
![[images/Pasted image 20230221160450.png]]

We can **modify the data** by update/create/delete: the `update` and `delete` operations can specify the criteria to select the documents to update or remove. Here an example of `insert` query:
```json
db.sensedData.insert( 
	{ 
		time:2011, 
		humid: 5, 
		... } 
	
	)
```

### Relevant issues in IoT
There are many issues in IoT and they're not easy to address:
- **Performance**: because microcontroller have a very low computation capacity there are physical and computational constraints to evaluate based on the type of activity to perform. This induces to optimize various parameters and metrics. 
- **Energy efficiency**
- **Security**
- **Data analysis/processing**: 
- **Communication/brokerage/binding**: How to bring together data producers (*sensors*) with consumers (*users/actuators/applications*). 
- **Data representation**: data formats and standardization
- **Interoperability**: many standard already exists at different level, like:
	- **MAC Level**: *Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4*
	- **Network level**: *ZigBee, Bluetooth, 6LowPan,*
	- **Application level**: : *MQTT, CoAP, oneM2M*
