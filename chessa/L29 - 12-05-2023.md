## Task-based model for energy neutrality
All of the steps implemented by an IoT device like *sensing, storing, processing and trasmitting* may have different alternative implementations with different duty cycles: what change is not the functional behavior but the non-functional one like *througtput, latency, etc*.
Each different implementation can correspond to different energy profile: each implementation is called **task** and when the device switch the implementation, this must be notified to the server to adapt the server expectation (*for example during transmit*), maybe notifying also other devices in the same network.

As an example, an application can choose different transducers (*sampling sensors*), each with a different energy consumption and performance by *disabling data processing* and only store data when the battery level is too low, scale up or down the sampling frequencym use more trasnducers to increase the utility level or communicates more/less frequently and reliably.

### Task-based model

This approach focuses on **modulating the load of the device** by using ***tasks***: it's achieved by *scheduling* tasks in execution, advertising the server which task is running to adapt the behavior. Based on the chosen type, for example, the application process all data and transmit only the result so the server may just store the received data or the application can transmits all the sensed data so the server has to process and then store the data. The number of tasks are limited by the device constraints and scheduling but the overall *system functionality* does not change, what is changed is only the implementation that have effect on the device's behavior.

The **task model** is discrete, definite task by task, differently from Kansal which exploited the linear relationship between utility, duty cycle and power consumption. A single task is charaterized by a **power consumption per unit of time** and the **utility gained** when it is executed.
As in Kansal, switch from a task to another have its own overhead: as in sampling, the frequecy of sampling must be guaranteed in the same slot unit. 
Here for each task, considering $k$ slots of time (*e.g. 24 slots a day, each of 1 hour*), we have a straight association with energy cost and utility:
![[Pasted image 20230514104715.png]]
A **scheduler** assigns one task per slot, fixing the schedule once per day (*e.g. at midnight*), obtaining the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230514104854.png]]


The underlying assumption is that the consumption during the same slot is constant, despite the effective consumption can be difficult to predict for the *forecaster*: as an example, a *weather forecast* allows to estimate the expected energy production in slot $i$ , indicated by $p_{s}(i)$ by evaluating the task assigned to each slot. 
#### Optimization problem formalization
The following relation compute the **expected power produced** and **not consumed** in slot $i$:
$p_{s}^{+}(i) = [p_{c}(i) - p_{s}(i)]^{+}$
This quantity correspond to the *recharges of the battery*, while the following one express the **expected power consumed** from the battery in slot $i$:
$p_{s}^{-}(i) = [p_{c}(i) - p_{s}(i)]^{+}$
It's noticeable to remember that that $p_{c}(i)$ express the power consumption in the slot $i$, while $p_{s}(i)$ express the power stored in the same slot. 
Overall, this formalization allows to express the **battery level at the end of the slot $i$** as:
$B(i+1) = min\{B_{max}, B(i)+\mu \times p_{s}^{+}(i) - p_{c}^{-}(i)\}$

where:
-  $\mu$ is the *charging efficiency of the battery*
- the $min$ operator allows to bound the battery level, limiting it to $B_{max}$
- $\mu \times p_{s}^{+}(i)$ express the **battery charge in the slot $i$**
- $p_{c}^{-}(i)$ express the power of the **battery consumed** in the slot $i$

The optimization problem thus can be formalized as:
$max \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=0}^{n}x_{i,j}\times u_{j}$
which is the **utility of the task assigned to the slots** (*$i$ is the slot index, $j$ the task index*). This formalization is valid under the following linear constraints:
1. $\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_{i,j}=1$ : only one task $j$ for each slot $i$
2. $B(1) \leq B(k+1)$ : define the admissibility of the solution
3. $B_{min} \leq B(i) \forall i \in [1,k]$: in a slot the battery charge cannot be below $B_{min}$, otherwise the device will stop working
4. $B(i+1) = min\{B_{max}, B(i)+\mu \times p_{s}^{+}(i) - p_{c}^{-}(i)\}, \forall i \in [1,k]$: the battery charge at the end of slot $i$ depends on the initial charge and the production and consumption in the slot.

The presented problem is *NP-Hard* but can be reduced to a version of knapsack. However exists a *pseudo-polynomial* solution based on dynamic programming that by providing realistic restriction can be run even on low-power devices.


### Dynamic Programming formalization
The *pseudo-polynomial* solution can be described taking into account the **system state** $(i,b)$ parameter, where:
- $i$ is the slot up to which the system is optimized
- $b$ is the corresponding battery level at the beginning of that slot
The **optimal utility** $opt(i,b)$ can be found using a backward recursive rule:
$opt(k,b) = max_{j=1..n} \{u_{j} : b + \mu \times p_{s}^{+}(i) - p_{c}^{-}(i) \geq B(1)\}$

where $k$ is the last slot and $opt(k,b)$ is the *base of induction*. The *recursive step* is express as:
$opt(i,b) = max_{j=1..n} \{u_{j} + opt(i+1, B^{j}(i+1): B^{j}(i+1) \geq B_{min})\}$
where $B^{j}(i+1)$ is the residual battery at the end of slot $i$ if the task $T_{j}$ is assigned to that slot. 

The algorithm is *pseudo polynomial* because, starting from slot one, we don't now the initial battery level so we must test all the values of the initial battery level. Using an ADC, the initial battery level are discrete (*limited by a maximum and a minimum delimited by the ADC itself*) thus the test are limited to a set of value. 
Arduino works with 10 bit, and excluding the battery level $< B_{min}$ remains only about 300 battery level thus the problem is tractable. 
Having limits also on the number of slots, we obtain a *time complexity* of $O(k \times battery_{level})$: the solution obtainable is sub-optimal due to an approximation of initial battery level. The complexity can be improved disregarding the number of task $k$ (*that is a small number*), obtaining $O(Battery_{levels})$. 


#### Execution times
#todo read first paper at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344447
Experimental evidences shows that the complexity remains in the order of $O(k \times Battery_{levels})$ but we can choose the number of slots $k$ and the battery level to keep the *feasibility* for the target platform. The following graph compare the execution time of  C code of *Arduino Uno, Raspberry PI* and a PC linux with a *battery max charge $B_{max} = 2000 mAh$*, *operative range* of $4.2V - 3.4V$, an ADC Of $10$ bits and *battery levels* ranging from $828$ and $1024$:

The data show that Arduino can support 96 slots before saturing the memory, corresponding to 15 min task duration.

Several simulated application have been tested with different duty cycles, from $2\%$ to $46\%$ over *Arduino Uno, Tmote* and *Raspberry PI* platform with a battery of $2000 mAh$ and solar panel *KL-SUN3W* with a number of slots from $24$ to $288$. The data shows the *utility* and the *average remaining level battery* over 12 months:

Lnger slots allows a better approximation of energy consumption and production: the quality of the opximiation depends on the granulairty of slots.

## Wireless Sensor Network
The classical approach for sensors when Wireless Sensor Network were proposed was to wire the transducer with a central elaboration unit that process the metrics taken from the environment.

The key idea behing WSN is to deploy sensors in a *Sensing Field* anf rom a network with one or more **sink nodes** that works as an interface from teh WSN to the exnternal world, alongside a set of wireless sensors.
The main purpose was to collect data from the environment, transmit to the sink node and send the data to a third location for processing.
The sink could be not always be present thus the sensors should be indepently and cooperate to be able to store and process, possible communicating with the sink when it reappears.
The deployment of those network must be easy to avoid mostly of human intervention, cheap and *programmable on the fly* by allowing updating or software modification, supporting the overwriting of the firmware software. Some solution to this problem are based on using a VM and replace the bytecode and not the entirely firmware code.
