## Energy sources
The energy sources can be classified based on the *controllability* property as:
- **Fully controllable**: energy sources that can provide harvestable energy whenever required.
- **Partially controllable**: the actual energy that you can transfer to the device may be limited by the environment. (* e.g. hydrielectric centrals does not contemplate summer months without rain*).
- **Non-controllable**: cannot be activates on-demand (*sun, win , etc*).

For the **un-controllable** energy sources, the classification involves the *predictability* property as:
- **Uncontrolled but predicatable**: energy sources are those for which there exists reliable models that forecast the energy availability. This type of sources are the best suitable for IoT application.
- **Uncontrolled and unpredictable**: are those for which there not exists reliable models that forecast the energy availability

In the following table are reported the main features of energy sources:
![[Pasted image 20230505162831.png]]
The interesting parameter is the *conversion efficiency* column and the *energy harvested column*.
In the following we discuss some of the harvesting sources commonly used.

##### 1. Radio Frequency (RF)
When *electromagnetic radio frequency (RF) field* passes through an *antenna coil*, an AC voltage is generated across the coil. A **passive RF tag** powers itself by using RF energy transmitted to it (*active RF tags have own battery*).
![[Pasted image 20230506081233.png]]
RFID reader queries an *RFID tag* by sending RF signal: RFID tag is entirely powered by the energy harvested by the antenna
coil. This energy is just sufficient to send back a reply.

##### 2. Piezo-electric
Use mechanical force to deform a piezo-electric material,
which results in an electric potential difference. Usually are composed by:
- **Piezo-electric films**: *PVDF (PolyVinylidene Fluoride)*
- **Piezo-electric ceramic**: *PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate)*
PVDF is more flexible than PZT.

#### 3. Wind turbines
Current wind turines can operate at different ranges of wind speed and are suitable for IoT mostly thanks to the *small size, low height* and *operative range*even with weak wind condition.
For a micro wind turbine, we report the data from *"Optimized Wind EnergyHarvesting System Using Resistance Emulator and Active Rectifier for Wireless Sensor Nodes", Yen Kheng et al. IEEE Transaction Jan. 2021*: 

![[Pasted image 20230506081753.png]]
Those value charaterize the mechanical and electrical part of the examined turbine, allowing to derive the following diagrams: the first shows that the wind is not fully controllable, the second diagram shows the electrical power generated for different wind speed and load applied, highlighting that the *maximum power* is generated when the **load resistance** matches the internal resistance of the generator.

#### 4. Solar energy
The production of the panel depends on parameters like:
- **Sun irradiance**:  indicates the amount of *solar rays* that are transmitted to the surface, measured in square meters. The efficiency is charaterized also by the *geographical position*, the weather cnditions, the daylight of the day and all the environmental factors.
- **Size of the panel**
- **Charging efficiency**: depends on the electronics and on the materials of the panel, usually $15\%$ for solar panel.
![[Pasted image 20230506082624.png]]

The **analytical model** is the theorical model to compute the daily power output and its distribution per hour in two different locationd, 
The following diagram picture the solar production of a solar panel in a timeframe of 24 hours: it shows that the *availability* of harvested energy varies in different period of the year thus a solution to be adopted is to **oversize** the harvesting subsystem and the battery to match with the *worst conditions*.
![[Pasted image 20230506083409.png]]

The following diageam shows the cloud day respect to the *irradiance value* (*refers to the transfer of energy between two bodies by means of electromagnetic waves*). 
![[Pasted image 20230506083653.png]]
The model is based on an approximation, forecasted by previous timeframed observation thus there can be differenes between the *real production* and the *estimated production* that cannot be precisely forecasted:
![[Pasted image 20230506084028.png]]
A solution to compensate the missing point of the analytical model can be to mix and match the *solar panel* with *wind energy* production, allowing to guarantee a more realistic and stable source of energy, as shown by *Cloudy Computing: Leveraging Weather Forecasts in Energy Harvesting Sensor
Systems", IEEE Secon 2010, Sharma et al.* diagram:
![[Pasted image 20230506084308.png]]

#### Limitations
The solution here presented does not guarantee that the device can be always operational, even for mixed solution because they depends on the capacity to forecast the energy production of the chosen sources. In case of harvesting solar and wind energy, must be considered also:
- In a night without wind thereâ€™s no energy production
-  The device relies only on the residual battery charge so if the residual charge is insufficient it may drop below the minimum and the device turns off. It will turn on again in the morning, when the source is return back to the minimum necessary to the device to be able to be operational. 

## Storage technologies
The battery and the harvester must be sized together to guarantee the device to be operational for the time required to be functional. 

The following table indicates the *battery type* and the *capacity* for each energy cell that can be charged by **reversing the internal chemical reaction**:
![[Pasted image 20230506084735.png]]
- caption: Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) Lithium Ion (Li-ion)

The **Pulse charging** involves delivering a series of high-energy pulses to the battery, followed by a resting period. During the resting period, the battery is allowed to recover and stabilize before the next pulse is delivered. This charging method is typically used for lead-acid batteries and is intended to reduce the buildup of lead sulfate on the battery plates, which can reduce the battery's capacity and lifespan. Pulse charging is also sometimes used for lithium-ion batteries to extend their lifespan.

The **Tickle charging**, on the other hand, involves applying a small, constant current to the battery after it has been fully charged. This current is intended to keep the battery topped up and prevent self-discharge. Tickle charging is often used for batteries that are used infrequently or left sitting for long periods of time, such as those in standby power supplies or backup generators.

#### Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that can store and release electrical energy very quickly: have a unique structure that consists of **two plates separated by an electrolyte**. The plates are *coated* with a *porous material* that provides a large surface area for the electrolyte to contact. This large surface area allows the super capacitor to store more charge than a traditional capacitor, and the separation of the plates by the electrolyte allows for the quick discharge and recharge of energy.
![[Pasted image 20230506085432.jpg]]
Super capacitors are commonly used in applications where a **quick burst of energy is needed**, such as in *electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and backup power systems*. The parameter that describe a common *supercapacitor* are reported in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230506085540.png]]
Supercapacitors also have a higher self-discharge rate than batteries, which means they will lose their stored energy more quickly when not in use.
![[Pasted image 20230506085756.png]]

The first diagram show that the *discharge curve* is linear, while the charging curve depends on many things because, fixing the same harvester, the speed of charging depends on the parameters that conditionate the harvester (*like the solar panel conditions the charge curve based on the sunny day of the year*).

## Measuring energy production
All the methods for power management in energy harvesting assume that the device has fresh information about the **battery charge** and the **actual energy production** from the harvesting source but the *accurate measurement* of these parameters is complex and not required for most devices. 
To avoid complex and costly solution, a simple method is to exploit *alredy known* parameters to **better approximate** the battery charge and energy production.

Assume we have the information about the *measurement of the battery charge $E_{b}(t)$* at time $t$ and the *power consumption $p_{c}(t)$* in a timeframe $[t1,t2]$ is known, then the energy $E_{e}$ produced in the same timeframe is given by:
			$E_{e} = [\int_{0}^{T} p_{c}(t)dt+E_{b}(t2)-E_{b}(t1)]^{+}$
where:
$\begin{equation}
    \[x\]^{+} =
    \begin{cases*}
      0 & if $x \leq 0$ \\
      x        & x > 0
    \end{cases*}
  \end{equation}$

The previous formula compute the energy produced by integrating the energy consumption plus the battery charge at time $t2$ (*at the end*) and subtracting the battery charge at the *start time* ($t1$): if the total is positive the production is positive.
This model refer to an ideal model with an **ideal energy buffer**, despite also other parameters can be introduce to obtain a more  accurate model.

This *analytical* approach have some drawbacks, like:
- errors in the measurement of the battery charge imply errors in the estimation of energy production
- if $[t1,t2]$ is too large it is difficult to know when the energy was available
- the *accurate estimation of the energy consumption $p_{c}(t)$* may not be easy

A better way is to **use ad-hoc electronics on board to measure the current flowing out** of the harvesting source and its voltage: the *battery charge* and the *voltage* are **linearly related**, thus the voltage drops down with the charge.
![[Pasted image 20230506091322.png]]

Consider a device that measures voltage by means of $d$-bits **ADC**, let also define:
- $B_{min}$: minimum battery charge
- $B_{max}$: maximum battery charge
- $v_{min}$: minimum battery *voltage*
- $v_{max}$: maximum battery *voltage*

The **ADC**  takes in input $v_{min},v_{max}$ and return in output  $x_{max},x_{min}$ computed as: 
$x_{max} = 2^{d}-1$
$x_{min} = ROUND [\frac{v_{min}}{v_{max}}\times (2^{d}-1)]$ 

Let $v$ be the *current battery voltage*, so the value $x$ read from the *ADC* is:
$x = ROUND [\frac{v}{v_{max}}\times (2^{d}-1)]$ 
and the corresponding current battery level $B$ is obtained by scaling $x$ respect to the values previously computed:
$B = B_{min}+\frac{B_{max}-B_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}} \times (x-x_{min})$


#### Exercise
Consider a device that samples the battery output voltage with an analog to digital converter (ADC) at $10$ bits.
The battery has a maximum charge of $2000 mAh$, and its maximum voltage (*when fully charged*) is $10$ Volts.
When the battery reaches a voltage of $8$ Volts the battery charge is $200mAh$ and it becomes insufficient to power the device.
Compute the **battery charge $B$** when the ADC outputs $920, 830, 1023$.

#### Solution
Summarize the data we already known:
- $d: 10$ bits
-  $B_{min}: 200mAh$
- $B_{max}: 2000mAh$
- $v_{min}: 8V$
- $v_{max}: 10V$
Now compute:
- $x_{max} = 2^{d}-1 = 1023$
- $x_{min} = ROUND [\frac{v_{min}}{v_{max}}\times (2^{d}-1)]=818$ 
Hence, when the ADC outputs:
- $x =920 \rightarrow B = 1096 mAh$ (*half the charge*) 
- $x = 830  \rightarrow B = 305 mAh$
- $x = 1023  \rightarrow B = 2000mAh$ (*full charge*)
Remembering that $B = B_{min}+\frac{B_{max}-B_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}} \times (x-x_{min})$. 

## Energy neutrality
We need to optmize both the power consumption and the harvesting-storage phase: this can be done by **modulating the load**. This can be done by reducing the amount of work to reduce the overall energy consumption: reduce the sampling frequency can have an impact also on the quality of the data produced thus the *range of accepatance* of each component and the grade of working function must be evaluated.

Power consumption varies according to the operational mode of a device: some activities like *sampling, transmitting, receiving* may be initially wake the sensor node from sleep, start the processor and radio but also other activities may be executed in background like *routing data packets, network management*, etc. In the following diagram the load of a device over time:
![[Pasted image 20230506093616.png]]
#todo sensor 2 and 3 are neutral under energy vision: the consumed the same amount of energy they produce, having a fair load. The level can be identified and setted for the sensors so theorically, the sensor can last forever.
