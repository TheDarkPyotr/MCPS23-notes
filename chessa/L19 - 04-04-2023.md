# MAC Protocols
In order to efficient the power consumption, is necessary to reduce/optimize the DC: this does not apply to radio interface directly so careful observation must be taken to address the activity of the radio interface at MAC layer. Operate ad MAC layer allows to reduce the radio duty cycle while mantaining network connectivity.
The optimal solution involves a tradeoff between *energy, latency* and *bandwidth*.
In this scenario, MAC protocols change their objectives: take the role of implementing DC by developing:
1. **Syncrhonization of nodes** (*as in S-MAC or IEEE 802.15*): implement a distributed protocol so the nodes agree on the activity period of the network. It's based on explicit syncrhonization.
2. **Preamble sampling** (*as B-MAC*): another way to obtain synchronization despite it's not a fully standardized mechanism.
3. **Polling** (*IEEE 802.15.4*): there is an asymmetry between the roles of the nodes in synchronizing process, with an ubalanced workload between the sender node and the receiver node.

Those approaches are implemented as **distributed coordination protocol**: the syncrhonization of the nodes is performed by agreeing **on when can turn on/off the radio**.
To build large multi-hop network those protocol can have an high impact on latency: the latency adopted by the synchronization protocols can be problematic for hundreds of devices (*e.g. multi-hop ZigBee network with high number of devices*) because each hop introduce additional delay due to the processing and transmission time of each node. This behavior can determine packet loss because of the sending is performed during inactive period of the neighbors's node.
The syncrhonization of nodes allows the node to turn on the radio simultaneosly by coordinating between all nodes and when the radios are active the network is connected while when the radio is inactive there is no network activity available.
The goal is to have radio low duty cycle, minimizing the overall energy consumption by remaining inactive for most of the time. 

### Syncrhonization: S-MAC
It's a *medium access control protocol* for wireless multi-hop network. 
The key idea is that it uses only **local syncronization**: the nodes implement synchronization locally by exchaging synchronization packets only with around neighbors. The farest node can be totally un-synchronized respect to a given node.

The syncronization mechanism of exchanging `SYNC` messages allows to synchronize the clock to a common timeframe of radio activation: to communicate they just to wait the activity period of the communication timeframe. A `SYNC` frame contains the ***schedule*** of the node: if a node detects adjacent ndoes with a pre-defined listen period will use the same period, otherwise it chooses its own period. The choosen period is advertised to the neighbors by `SYNC` frames.
So nodes alternate *listen* and *sleep* periods in which, during sleep time, the sensor cannot detect incoming messages.
Two different nodes can decide different schedule of activity for the radio but the *"most popular schedule"* among the neighbors it's the most suitable to communicate with the highest range of devices.
A node may revert to someone else schedule if its own schedule it's not shared by any other device.

A node **receives** frame from the neighbors during its own **listen period**: node `A` can send a frame to node `B` only during the listen period of `B`:
- node `A` may need to turn on its radio also outside its listen period 
- node `A` should know all the listen periods of its neighbors 
- At startup a node preliminary listens the `SYNC` frame of its neighbors
![[Pasted image 20230404171403.png]]
In the previous exchange, `A` and `B` have the same listen period so they're able to communicate without problem: the communication between `B` and `C` require that the node `B` active its radio in the listen period of `C`, despite it's outside of its own active period.

So the frame are sent during the listen period of the receiver: the problem of **collision** arises if two nodes have the same listen period, they will sedn packets on the same time.  To avoid collisions, the adaptive duty cycle use a **Carrier Sense** check it's executed before the transmissison and if the channel is busy and a node fails to get the medium, the frame is delayed to the next period. So if an RTS or CTS is received, the radio is keeped up until the end of the transmission just incase it's the next hop of commnication. This simple optimization allows avoiding collisions on the communciation channel.

The ***S-MAC Energy Consumption*** follows the diagram here presented. The  diagram shows the *aggregate energy consumption over a 10-hops path*: as the data shows, the adaptive duty cycle is a little optimization used by S-MAC so if a node overhears a RTS or a CTS it keeps its radio on until the end of the transmission just in case it's the next hop of communication.
As the diagram shows, the **larger is inter-arrival, the smaller is the load of the network**. 
![[Pasted image 20230404171944.png]]

#### Latency 
While traveling across a multihop path a frame may have to wait (*in the worst case*) for the listen period of each intermediate node. 
This is mitigated by the fact that (*hopefully*) a number of nodes will converge towards the same schedule (*not guaranteed anyway*)

Latency must be well addressed, as shown by the following exchange:
![[Pasted image 20230405103011.png]]
From `A` to `C` the communication can happen within one activty perio but between `C` and `D` there is a *waiting time*, the same happen with `E` and `F`: this *waiting periods* increase the overall latency.
A trade-off must be achieved because a larger duty cycle ca surely lower the latency but increasing the energy consumption. 

Another problems that affects the Iot devices is the **quality of clock component** that usually it's not suitable for exact sycnrhonzation: they are cheap and are affected by environmental conditions. There are conditions that make clocks of different devices diverge (*e.g. a device with a shield vs no shield respect to temperature impact*), impacting the syncrhonziation between the devices. 

### Preamble Sampling: B-MAC
The key idea is to reduce the complexity of the protocol, obtaining syncrhonization by differenciating the behavior of the receiver and the transmitter. A **sender** sends whener it want that contains a very long preamble in it's header while the **receiver** activates its radio perdiocally to check if there is a preambe on the air. This last activity is called **preamble sampling** and it's based on ***Low-Power Listening (LPL) mode***.

If the receiver during the *preamble sampling* detects a preamble **keeps the radio on to receive the frame**, otherwise turns off the radio.
The idea is to spend more in transmission but save energy in reception because the preamble sampling should be very short and cheap. The costs of radio activation/deactivation at the receiver side are balanced by a *low rate sampling*
Surely to be effective, this implies that th **preamble should be longer than the sleep period**.
![[Pasted image 20230405103750.png]]

The green peaks in the previous image indicates the **preamble sampling** for small fraction of time. The interval between two *peaks (sleep period)* it's a fixed parameter given by the B-MAC protocol. The sampling duration, differently, cannot be enforced by the protocol but depends on the specific device/hardware performances.
To avoid partially communication by receiver side, the **long preamble** it's used: it does not contains anything useful but the only purpose it's to signal that meaningful packets will be sent at the end of the preamble packets.. 
The protocol work because the lenght of the preamble is longer than the interval between two periods. 

The idea is to give *more work to the transmitter, lesser to the receiver*: in multi-hop devices network this allows to save the overall energy if a scenario with multiple receivers. 

As mentioned, the preamble sampling it's based on **Low-Power Listening (LPL)** that also have its own overhead: the following diagram shows the Current consumption over time for the *Mica-Mote* radio during its initialization/startup/trasnmission/sleep phases.
![[Pasted image 20230405104057.png]]

The radio keeps an internal clock to be synchronized to the bit flowing on the radio channel: this require an initial setup by the clock (`init radio`). The diagram also idnicate that the *init* phase must be avoided over time to reduce the current consumption. Another result is that the transmission represent the activity with the most current expenditure, alongside the ADC (Analog-Digital Converter) activity period. 

This simple model allows us to define a **model**, both for transmitter and receiver:
![[Pasted image 20230405104440.png]]

To **model the lifetime** we need make some assumption like that there is only *one receiver and one transmitter*. Their parameter are:
1. $f_{data}$ : frequency of **transmitted data** (*in hertz $\frac{1}{sec}$* )
2. $f_{check}$: frequency of **preamble samplig**

Hence, at the **transmitter** (*considering only the radio activity*), we have:
- **Duty cycle data**: $DC_{tx} = f_{data}*(t_{preamble}+t_{data})$
- **Duty cycle check**: $DC_{check} = f_{check}*t_{check}$
- **Energy (*in joule*) spent in $t$ seconds at the transmitter side**:
		$ET(t) = t * (p_{tx}*DC_{tx}+p_{rx}*DC_{check}+p_{sleep}*(1-DC_{tx}-DC_{check})$

While, at the **receiver side** we have:
- **Duty cycle data**: $DC_{rec} = f_{data}*(\frac{1}{2}t_{preamble}+t_{data})$
- **Duty cycle check**: $DC_{check} = f_{check}*t_{check}$
- **Energy (*in joule*) spent in $t$ seconds at the receiver side**:
		$Er(t) = t * (p_{rx}*DC_{rec}+p_{rx}*DC_{check}+p_{sleep}*(1-DC_{rec}-DC_{check})$

Thus, the overall **lifetime** are:
- **Transmitter**: $lifetime= battery_{charge}/ET(1)$
- **Receiver**: $lifetime = battery_{charge}/ER(1)$
In the following table are sketched some value of the specified parameter from the original BMAC paper for the *CC1000 radio*:

##### Lifetime diagrams
The following results assume a battery of $3000 mAh$ and disregard the processing, sensing and battery leaks in the computation.
The following diagram shows the lifetime at *transmitter side*, showing that by decreasing the sample frequency interval ($t\_check$) (*from 1sample every min to 1 sample every 20 min*) we can increase te overall lifetime:
![[Pasted image 20230409084848.png]]
The same pattern is showed for the *receiver side*:
![[Pasted image 20230409084955.png]]

The previous model consider only two nodes (*one receiver and one transmitter*): even considering several transmitters, the lifetime trend does not change.
The node *lifetime* depends on the **check interval** (*of preamble sampling*) and the total amount of traffic in the network cell. 
Each line in the following diagrams shows the lifetime of a node at that sampe rate and LPL (*Low-Power-Listening*) check interval: the circles occur at the maximum lifetime (*indicating optimal check intervals*) for each sample rate.

### Stenghts and drawbacks
As mentioned previous, the clock must be not necessarily syncrhonzied but by measuring the same way the time: 1 second must corresponds to 1s in every device, despite, as previously mentioned, the decreasing quality of measuring of the clocks used in IoT device.
The **strengths** of the B-MAC Protocol are:
1. It's not a network organization protocol
2. It's simple to use and configure (*having only one parameter*)
3. It's transparent at the higher layers
Despite, the potential **drawbacks** are:
1. Long check intervals have an impact on the througput of the network but in IoT this is acceptable. B-MAC is suitable for low transmission rate. 
2. Long check interval imply long, expensive preambles
3. In some cases it may result more expensive than using other form of synchronization


### X-MAC
*X-MAX* is an evolution of B-MAC aimed at **reducing the impact of long preambles**. 
It allows a *receiver* to stop the preamble transmission: the preamble this time contain also information of the **ID of target node** so a receiver can check if it's the recipient of the frame and interrupts the preamble transmission to request the data frame. 
Here the comparison schema between *LPL (B-MAC)* and *X-MAC*:
![[Pasted image 20230409090007.png]]
During the *transmission phase*, the transmitter ($S$) send *short preambles* containing the target address information: when the receiver ($R$) wakes up, catch the short preamble and reply with an **early ACK** that allows $S$ to stop the sending of short preamble and start sending the **data frame**. 

After receive a frame, the receiver $R$ does not turn off the radio immediately to allows other nodes that wanted to transmitduring the preamble transmission but were'nt allowed (*as they sensed the channel was occupied*), so receivers remaning active to catch eventually other communciations: this is indicatd by the gray area after $R$'s receptio phase  (*low part diagram X-MAC*).

##### X-MAC vs B-MAC
The comparison is made by simulation on **total duty cycle of transmitters**: the scenario was a *star connected network* with 1 receiver and several transmitter that varies over time. Each station transmits every 9 seconds with randomized jitter, using also different LPL intervals (*different check intervals of B-MAC*). 
![[Pasted image 20230409090844.png]]

Another following development of X-MAC is known as ***BoX-MAX***: it still try to reduce the impact of long preamble by attaching inside the preamble message also the data itself, so the receiver send an ACK after having received the packets containing both the preamble and the data frame. This is suitable for **small data packets**.
![[Pasted image 20230409091352.png]]

Here a schema in for a **multi-hop routing** in BoX-MAC: the transmission involves three different nodes. The first node $i1$ try the transmission multiple time before having success: the node $i2$ first need to sample the channel and then receive the communication so it's allowed to send a *ACK-TX* to $i1$ and the same process is repeated between $i2$ and $i3$.

##### Polling
This methods is widely used in IEEE 802.15.4: can be combined with other syncrhonization methods and usually allows an **asymmetric organization** of the nodes by having  *one master* that issues periodic beacons and *several slave nodes* that can keep the radio off whenever they want. (*See lecture on  IEEE 802.15.4 for more details*).
