# MAC Protocols
In order to efficient the power consumption, is necessary to reduce/optimize the DC: this does not apply to radio interface directly so careful observation must be taken to address the activity of the radio interface at MAC layer. Operate ad MAC layer allows to reduce the radio duty cycle while mantaining network connectivity.
The optimal solution involves a tradeoff between *energy, latency* and *bandwidth*.
In this scenario, MAC protocols change their objectives: take the role of implementing DC by developing:
1. **Syncrhonization of nodes** (*as in S-MAC or IEEE 802.15*): implement a distributed protocol so the nodes agree on the activity period of the network. It's based on explicit syncrhonization.
2. **Preamble sampling** (*as B-MAC*): another way to obtain synchronization despite it's not a fully standardized mechanism.
3. **Polling** (*IEEE 802.15.4*): there is an asymmetry between the roles of the nodes in synchronizing process, with an ubalanced workload between the sender node and the receiver node.

Those approaches are implemented as **distributed coordination protocol**: the syncrhonization of the nodes is performed by agreeing **on when can turn on/off the radio**.
To build large multi-hop network those protocol can have an high impact on latency: the latency adopted by the synchronization protocols can be problematic for hundreds of devices (*e.g. multi-hop ZigBee network with high number of devices*) because each hop introduce additional delay due to the processing and transmission time of each node. This behavior can determine packet loss because of the sending is performed during inactive period of the neighbors's node.
The syncrhonization of nodes allows the node to turn on the radio simultaneosly by coordinating between all nodes and when the radios are active the network is connected while when the radio is inactive there is no network activity available.
The goal is to have radio low duty cycle, minimizing the overall energy consumption by remaining inactive for most of the time. 

### Syncrhonization: S-MAC
It's a *medium access control protocol* for wireless multi-hop network. 
The key idea is that it uses only **local syncronization**: the nodes implement synchronization locally by exchaging synchronization packets only with around neighbors. The farest node can be totally un-synchronized respect to a given node.

The syncronization mechanism of exchanging `SYNC` messages allows to synchronize the clock to a common timeframe of radio activation: to communicate they just to wait the activity period of the communication timeframe. A `SYNC` frame contains the ***schedule*** of the node: if a node detects adjacent ndoes with a pre-defined listen period will use the same period, otherwise it chooses its own period. The choosen period is advertised to the neighbors by `SYNC` frames.
So nodes alternate *listen* and *sleep* periods in which, during sleep time, the sensor cannot detect incoming messages.
Two different nodes can decide different schedule of activity for the radio but the *"most popular schedule"* among the neighbors it's the most suitable to communicate with the highest range of devices.
A node may revert to someone else schedule if its own schedule it's not shared by any other device.

A node **receives** frame from the neighbors during its own **listen period**: node `A` can send a frame to node `B` only during the listen period of `B`:
- node `A` may need to turn on its radio also outside its listen period 
- node `A` should know all the listen periods of its neighbors 
- At startup a node preliminary listens the `SYNC` frame of its neighbors
![[Pasted image 20230404171403.png]]
In the previous exchange, `A` and `B` have the same listen period so they're able to communicate without problem: the communication between `B` and `C` require that the node `B` active its radio in the listen period of `C`, despite it's outside of its own active period.

So the frame are sent during the listen period of the receiver: the problem of **collision** arises if two nodes have the same listen period, they will sedn packets on the same time.  To avoid collisions, the adaptive duty cycle use a **Carrier Sense** check it's executed before the transmissison and if the channel is busy and a node fails to get the medium, the frame is delayed to the next period. So if an RTS or CTS is received, the radio is keeped up until the end of the transmission just incase it's the next hop of commnication. This simple optimization allows avoiding collisions on the communciation channel. 
![[Pasted image 20230404171802.png]]


The ***S-MAC Energy Consumption*** follows the diagram here presented. The  diagram shows the *aggregate energy consumption over a 10-hops path*: as the data shows, the adaptive duty cycle is a little optimization used by S-MAC so if a node overhears a RTS or a CTS it keeps its radio on until the end of the transmission just in case it's the next hop of communication.
As the diagram shows, the **larger is inter-arrival, the smaller is the load of the network**. 
![[Pasted image 20230404171944.png]]

#### Latency 
While traveling across a multihop path a frame may have to wait (*in the worst case*) for the listen period of each intermediate node. 
This is mitigated by the fact that (*hopefully*) a number of nodes will converge towards the same schedule (*not guaranteed anyway*)

Latency must be well addressed, as shown by the following exchange:
![[Pasted image 20230405103011.png]]
From `A` to `C` the communication can happen within one activty perio but between `C` and `D` there is a *waiting time*, the same happen with `E` and `F`: this *waiting periods* increase the overall latency.
A trade-off must be achieved because a larger duty cycle ca surely lower the latency but increasing the energy consumption. 

Another problems that affects the Iot devices is the **quality of clock component** that usually it's not suitable for exact sycnrhonzation: they are cheap and are affected by environmental conditions. There are conditions that make clocks of different devices diverge (*e.g. a device with a shield vs no shield respect to temperature impact*), impacting the syncrhonziation between the devices. 

### Preamble Sampling: B-MAC
The key idea is to reduce the complexity of the protocol, obtaining syncrhonization by differenciating the behavior of the receiver and the transmitter. A **sender** sends whener it want that contains a very long preamble in it's header while the **receiver** activates its radio perdiocally to check if there is a preambe on the air. This last activity is called **preamble sampling** and it's based on ***Low-Power Listening (LPL) mode***.

If the receiver during the *preamble sampling* detects a preamble **keeps the radio on to receive the frame**, otherwise turns off the radio.
The idea is to spend more in transmission but save energy in reception because the preamble sampling should be very short and cheap. The costs of radio activation/deactivation at the receiver side are balanced by a *low rate sampling*
Surely to be effective, this implies that th **preamble should be longer than the sleep period**.
![[Pasted image 20230405103750.png]]

The green peaks in the previous image indicates the **preamble sampling** for small fraction of time. The interval between two *peaks (sleep period)* it's a fixed parameter given by the B-MAC protocol. The sampling duration, differently, cannot be enforced by the protocol but depends on the specific device/hardware performances.
To avoid partially communication by receiver side, the **long preamble** it's used: it does not contains anything useful but the only purpose it's to signal that meaningful packets will be sent at the end of the preamble packets.. 
The protocol work because the lenght of the preamble is longer than the interval between two periods. 

The idea is to give *more work to the transmitter, lesser to the receiver*: in multi-hop devices network this allows to save the overall energy if a scenario with multiple receivers. 

As mentioned, the preamble sampling it's based on **Low-Power Listening (LPL)** that also have its own overhead: the following diagram shows the Current consumption over time for the *Mica-Mote* radio during its initialization/startup/trasnmission/sleep phases.
![[Pasted image 20230405104057.png]]

The radio keeps an internal clock to be synchronized to the bit flowing on the radio channel: this require an initial setup by the clock (`init radio`). The diagram also idnicate that the *init* phase must be avoided over time to reduce the current consumption. Another result is that the transmission represent the activity with the most current expenditure, alongside the ADC (Analog-Digital Converter) activity period. 

This simple model allows us to define a **model**, both for transmitter and receiver:
![[Pasted image 20230405104440.png]]

To **model the lifetime** we need make some assumption like that there is only *one receiver and one transmitter*. Their parameter are:
1. $f_{data}$ : frequency of **transmitted data** (*in hertz $\frac{1}{sec}$* )
2. $f_{check}$: frequency of **preamble samplig**

Hence, at the **transmitter** (*considering only the radio activity*), we have:
- **Duty cycle data**: $DC_{tx} = f_{data}*(t_{preamble}+t_{data})$
- **Duty cycle check**: $DC_{check} = f_{check}*t_{check}$
- **Energy (*in joule*) spent in $t$ seconds at the transmitter side**:
		$ET(t) = t * (p_{tx}*DC_{tx}+p_{rx}*DC_{check}+p_{sleep}*(1-DC_{tx}-DC_{check})$

While, at the **receiver side** we have:
- **Duty cycle data**: $DC_{rec} = f_{data}*(\frac{1}{2}t_{preamble}+t_{data})$
- **Duty cycle check**: $DC_{check} = f_{check}*t_{check}$
- **Energy (*in joule*) spent in $t$ seconds at the receiver side**:
		$Er(t) = t * (p_{rx}*DC_{rec}+p_{rx}*DC_{check}+p_{sleep}*(1-DC_{rec}-DC_{check})$

Thus, the overall **lifetime** are:
- **Transmitter**: $lifetime= battery_{charge}/ET(1)$
- **Receiver**: $lifetime = battery_{charge}/ER(1)$
In the following table are sketched some value of the specified parameter from the original BMAC paper for the *CC1000 radio*:
![[Pasted image 20230409084546.png]]



##### Lifetime diagrams
The following results assume a battery of $3000 mAh$ and disregard the processing, sensing and battery leaks in the computation.
The following diagram shows the lifetime at *transmitter side*, showing that by decreasing the sample frequency interval ($t\_check$) (*from 1sample every min to 1 sample every 20 min*) we can increase te overall lifetime:
![[Pasted image 20230409084848.png]]
The same pattern is showed for the *receiver side*:
![[Pasted image 20230409084955.png]]

The previous model consider only two nodes (*one receiver and one transmitter*): even considering several transmitters, the lifetime trend does not change.
The node *lifetime* depends on the **check interval** (*of preamble sampling*) and the total amount of traffic in the network cell. 
Each line in the following diagrams shows the lifetime of a node at that sampe rate and LPL (*Low-Power-Listening*) check interval: the circles occur at the maximum lifetime (*indicating optimal check intervals*) for each sample rate.
![[Pasted image 20230409085338.png]]



### Stenghts and drawbacks
As mentioned previous, the clock must be not necessarily syncrhonzied but by measuring the same way the time: 1 second must corresponds to 1s in every device, despite, as previously mentioned, the decreasing quality of measuring of the clocks used in IoT device.
The **strengths** of the B-MAC Protocol are:
1. It's not a network organization protocol
2. It's simple to use and configure (*having only one parameter*)
3. It's transparent at the higher layers
Despite, the potential **drawbacks** are:
1. Long check intervals have an impact on the througput of the network but in IoT this is acceptable. B-MAC is suitable for low transmission rate. 
2. Long check interval imply long, expensive preambles
3. In some cases it may result more expensive than using other form of synchronization


### X-MAC
*X-MAX* is an evolution of B-MAC aimed at **reducing the impact of long preambles**. 
It allows a *receiver* to stop the preamble transmission: the preamble this time contain also information of the **ID of target node** so a receiver can check if it's the recipient of the frame and interrupts the preamble transmission to request the data frame. 
Here the comparison schema between *LPL (B-MAC)* and *X-MAC*:
![[Pasted image 20230409090007.png]]
During the *transmission phase*, the transmitter ($S$) send *short preambles* containing the target address information: when the receiver ($R$) wakes up, catch the short preamble and reply with an **early ACK** that allows $S$ to stop the sending of short preamble and start sending the **data frame**. 

After receive a frame, the receiver $R$ does not turn off the radio immediately to allows other nodes that wanted to transmitduring the preamble transmission but were'nt allowed (*as they sensed the channel was occupied*), so receivers remaning active to catch eventually other communciations: this is indicatd by the gray area after $R$'s receptio phase  (*low part diagram X-MAC*).

##### X-MAC vs B-MAC
The comparison is made by simulation on **total duty cycle of transmitters**: the scenario was a *star connected network* with 1 receiver and several transmitter that varies over time. Each station transmits every 9 seconds with randomized jitter, using also different LPL intervals (*different check intervals of B-MAC*). 
![[Pasted image 20230409090844.png]]

Another following development of X-MAC is known as ***BoX-MAX***: it still try to reduce the impact of long preamble by attaching inside the preamble message also the data itself, so the receiver send an ACK after having received the packets containing both the preamble and the data frame. This is suitable for **small data packets**.
![[Pasted image 20230409091352.png]]

Here a schema in for a **multi-hop routing** in BoX-MAC: the transmission involves three different nodes. The first node $i1$ try the transmission multiple time before having success: the node $i2$ first need to sample the channel and then receive the communication so it's allowed to send a *ACK-TX* to $i1$ and the same process is repeated between $i2$ and $i3$.   


![[Pasted image 20230409091501.png]]




##### Polling
This methods is widely used in IEEE 802.15.4: can be combined with other syncrhonization methods and usually allows an **asymmetric organization** of the nodes by having  *one master* that issues periodic beacons and *several slave nodes* that can keep the radio off whenever they want. (*See lecture on  IEEE 802.15.4 for more details*).



# IEEE 802.15.4 Standard
*The following chapter is entirely based on "J. Zheng and A. Jamalipour, Wireless Sensor Networks: A Networking Perspective, Wiley-IEEE Press"*.

The **IEEE 802.15.4 standard** specifies the **physical** and **MAC layers** for low-rate wireless *Personal Area Networks (PAN)*. Its protocol stack is simple and flexible, it does not require any infrastructure and it is suitable for short-range communications (*typically within a range of 10 meters*). 
For these reasons it features ease of installation, low cost, and a reasonable battery life of the devices.
The physical layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 has been designed to coexist with other IEEE standards for wireless networks such as *IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth)*. It features activation and deactivation of the radio transceiver and transmission of packets on the physical medium. It operates in one of the following three license-free bands:
- $868–868.6 MHz$ (*e.g., Europe*) with a data rate of $20$ kbps;
- $902–928 MHz$ (*e.g., North America*) with a data rate of $40$ kbps; or
- $2400–2483.5 MHz$ (*worldwide*) with a data rate of $250$ kbps.

The MAC layer provides ***data and management services*** to the upper layers. The **data service** enables transmission and reception of MAC packets (*Protocol Data Unit (PPDU)*) across the physical layer. 
The **management services** include synchronization of the communications, management of guaranteed time slots, and association and disassociation of devices to the network. This is performed by a set of features like **Energy Detection (ED), Link Quality Indicator (LQI)** (*that allows to chose the best channel for a given communication*), **Channel Selection**, **Clearl Channel Assessment (CCA)**, etc (*More information later*). In addition the MAC layer implements basic security mechanisms.

### Physical layer
There are several channels operating at different frequencies ($Mhz$) as pictured here: the lower channels are used for short range devices (*baby monitor, automatic gate remote controller, etc*) while the upper channels (*11-26*) are for large range of communications.
![[Pasted image 20230409093421.png]]

It's designed to operate well even in highly noisy environment: the physical channel is designed to be more robust respect to Bluettoth as shown in the following diagram.
![[Pasted image 20230409094546.png]]
As mentioned in the previous chapters, the **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** is a measure of the strength of a signal relative to the background noise present in a given environment or system. It is expressed as a ratio of the *signal power* to the *noise power*, typically measured in decibels ($dB$).

In communication systems, the signal refers to the information or data that is being transmitted, while noise refers to any unwanted or random fluctuations in the signal. **The higher the SNR, the better the quality of the signal and the more accurate the transmission of information**. Conversely, a low SNR indicates a weaker signal that is more susceptible to errors and interference from noise.

The **Energy Detection (ED)** is used to find a free channel and for carrier sense: the estimation time for ED equals the average over 8 sumbols interval. The **detection threshold** is at $10dB$ above the sensitivity level.
The **Link Quality Indicator (LQI)** indicates the quality of data packets that are received by a node: it's based on ED or on the *signal/noise ratio*. It's assesed each time a packet is received and must contemplate 8 different levels of quality.
The estimated value for *LQI* is forwarded to the network and application layers.

For the **Channel Assessment**, the main objective is to detect if the channel is *busy* and operates in 3 modes:
- **Mode 1**: uses ED; if the energy level exceeds the detection threshold, then the channel is marked as *busy*. 
- **Mode 2**: perform *Carrier Sense*, the channel is *busy* if the detected signal has the same characteristics as the sender. 
- **Mode 3**: Combination of modes 1 et 2 (*AND/OR*).


#### Data services
At the *physical layer*, the *PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit)* reports the rsult of the transmission to the upper layer (*if successfull or failed*). The main reason for a transmission to fail are:
1. radio transceiver *out of order*
2. radio transceiver is in the *reception mode*
3. radio transceiver is *busy*

The **frame** have the structure pictured in the following image:

![[Pasted image 20230409095527.png]]
It's composed by:
- **SHR (Synchronization Header)**: synchronisation with the receiver
- **PHR (PHY Header)**: information about the frame length
- **PHY Payload**: the MAC frame
- **SFD (Start-of-frame delimiter)** : tell the receiver that the real data is beginning
- **PSDU (Physical Service Data Unit)**: it's the actual payload, up to $127$ bytes. It's not a good idea to use all of them all despite are only few bytes: with long frames there are problem of carrier sense and multiple access. 



### MAC Layer
Also at the MAC Layer, we can differentiate three different types of services:
1. ***Data services***: transmission and reception of **MAC frames (MPDU)** across the physical layer.
2. ***Managament services***: perform *synchronization of the communications, channel access, management of guaranteed time slots,association and disassociation of devices.
3. ***Security services***: allows *data encryption, access control, frame integrity and sequential freshness*.

The MAC layer defines two types of nodes: ***Reduced Function Devices (RFDs)*** and ***Full Function Devices (FFDs)***. 
**RFD** are meant to implement end-devices with reduced processing, memory, and communication capabilities which implement a subset of the MAC layer functions. In particular the RFD can only associate to an existing network and they depend on **FFDs** for communication. One *RFD* can be associated to only one FFD at a time. Example of RFD devices are simple sensors or actuators like light switches,
lamps and similar devices.
The ***FFDs*** implement the full MAC layer and they can act aither as the *Personal Area Network (PAN)* coordinator or as a generic coordinator of a set of RFDs. The PAN coordinator sets up and manages the network, in particular it selects the PAN identifier and manages associations or disassociation of devices.
In the association phase the PAN coordinator assigns to the new device a 16 bit address. This address can be used in alternative to the standard 64 bit extended IEEE address which is statically assigned to each device.

![[Pasted image 20230409100959.png]]


The FFDs cooperate to implement the **network topology**. The actual network formation is performed at the network layer, but the MAC layer provides support to two types of network topologies: ***star*** and ***peer-to-peer*** (*as shown in the previous image*).
In the **star topology** one FFD is the PAN coordinator and it is located in the star centre.  All the other FFD and RFD behave as generic devices and they can only communicate with the coordinator which synchronizes all the communications in the network.  Different stars operating in the same area have different PAN identifier and operate independently of each other.

In the **peer to peer topology** each FFD is capable of communicating with any other device within its radio range. One *FFD (normally the FFD which initiated the network)* act as PAN coordinator, and the other *FFDs* act as routers or end devices to form a multihop network as shown in the previous figure. The *RFDs* act as
end devices and each RFD is connected only with one *FFD*.


### Channel access
The MAC protocol have two channel access: 
1. **superframe structure**:is used in star topologies (*it can also be used in peer to peer topologyes organized in trees*) and provides synchronization between nodes to enable energy savings of the devices.
2. **no superframe structure**: is more general and can be used to support communications in arbitrary peer to peer topologies.


#### 1. Access with superframe
A superframe is composed by an **active** and an **inactive** portion. All the communications happen during the active portion, hence the *PAN coordinator (and the connected devices)* may enter a *low power (sleep)* mode during the inactive portion. The active portion comprises up to *16* **equally sized time slots**. 
The first time slots is the ***beacon frame*** and is sent by the PAN coordinator to begin the superframe. The beacon frames are used to synchronize the attached devices, to identify the PAN, and to describe the structure of the superframes. 

The actual communications between the end devices and the coordinator take place in the *remaining time slots*. The time slots in the active portion are divided into a ***Contention Access Period (CAP)*** and a (*optional*) ***Contention Free Period (CFP)***.

![[Pasted image 20230409102712.png]]

In the **CAP period** the devices compete for channel access using a standard slotted *CSMA-CA protocol (Carries Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)*.  This means that a device wishing to transmit data frames first waits for the beacon frame and then it *randomly selects a time slot for its transmission*: if the selected time slot is busy because another communication is already ongoing (*this is detected using carrier sense*) then the device selects randomly another time slot. If the channel is *idle*, the device can begin transmitting on the next slot.

The **CFP period** is optional and it is used for low-latency applications or applications requiring specific data bandwidth. To this purpose the PAN coordinator may assign portions of the active superframe (*called
**Guaranteed Time Slots** or GTS*) to specific applications. The GTSs form the **contention-free period (CFP)**, which always begins at the end of the active superframe starting at a slot boundary immediately following the CAP. Each GTS may comprise more than one time slots and it is assigned to an individual application which access it without contention.
![[Pasted image 20230409103442.png]]
In any case the PAN coordinator *always leave a sufficient number of frames for the CAP period for the other devices and to manage the ssociation/disassociation protocols*. Note also that all contention-based transactions shall be complete before the beginning of the CFP, and each device transmitting in a GTS shall complete its transmission within its GTS.
