### Moore's Law
*"The number of transistor that can be embedded in a chip grows exponentially (it doubles every two year)"*.
As a comparison example:
- Intel 4004 in 1971: 2.3k transistors, 740 KHz and 4KB program memory
- Itel core i9  in 2017: 1.8G transistos, 4.4.GHz, 165W and 128 GB
The application of moore's law to IoT is peculiar and subject to different interpretation:
1. The *performance doubles every two years* at the same cost
2. The *chip's size halves* every two year at the same cost
3. The sixe and the processing power remain the same bu the cost halves every two year
In IoT all those interpretation are true, based on the specifics scenario: there are application that require small sized sensors and or that ahve low power comsuption, can require higher processing capabilities. There is the need to balance the computational power to the costs, based on the specific application.

The moore's law does not necessarily solve the problem in IoT design, at least in the near future. 

## Energy efficiency
It represent one of the critical aspects because devices are usually battery-powered, avoid wired powered devices and avoid maintenance cost. 
The energy effiency is one of the main aspects in IoT design. 
The following diagram shows how the evolution of *processor, HD capacity and memory* grows faster than battery efficiency:
![[Pasted image 20230324162428.png]]
The improvements of the battery efficiency is not bound to the Moore's Law: this is also due to the physic limit. The consequences are that in we want to improve the battery efficiency, we need to improve the design aspects of an IoT system, improving the design of the components that heavily rely on battery.

In a laptop, most of the energy in spent on a screen, as shown in the following diagram:
![[Pasted image 20230324162704.png]]
In a wireless sensor, the energy usage is the following one:
![[Pasted image 20230324162732.png]]
The percentage areas can vary based on the specific sensors. There is a trade-off between sensing and transmission: *"a general rule state that transmit 1 byte is equal to compute 1k byte"*.
Usually the sensing activation frequency it's mandatory based on a given context: reducing it have a direct impact on the quality of sensing data. The opmitizable component is surely the processor area but, differently, the sensing area cannot be opmitized muchly because it both transmit and receive: the optimizable part is the one that concern the communication timeframe and behavior.
A radio for **WIfi Network Interface** can be in three modes:
1. Sleep Mode: consume very less and can get the radio operative in short time. The energy consumption is around 10mA. 
2. Listen Mode: 180mA
3. Receive Mode: 200mA
4. Transmit Mde: 280 mA

For a sensor (*moto-clone*) the energy consumption is:
1. Sleep Mode:  0.0.16mW
2. Listen Mode:  12.35 mW
3. Receive Mode: 12.50mW
4. Transmit Mde: 0.1 power level, 19.2kbps: 12.36 mW
							1. 0.4 power level, 19.2kbps: 15.54 mW
							2. 0.7 power level, 19.2kbps: 17.76 mW
 The power level can change based on the distance that are needed to communicate, amplyfing the signal. In case of receive mode, it's also necessary to activate a decoder (from a given analogical signal) that require more energy.
Those numbers show how it's not useful to put the sleep mode only, but remaining in a listen mode, letting the device comunicate. 
This had an impact on the MAC protocols for IoT which differs from the standard definition.
So for sensors, as a rule of thumb, the approach is:
- transmit power is less than receive power
- listen power is more or less equal to receive power
- radio should be turned off as much as possible
Switching on and off a component require energy: the decision to switch the status must not be reversed in a short timeframe. 

The IoT device are not a general purpose device so it's not needed to be active all the time, providing the service: the key idea is to saving energy by **reducing the period of activity of a sensor**. This is called **duty cycle** and define the repetitivity of the activities of a sensors:
1. Sense: it's more efficient if it's repeated periodically and it's in a constant timeframe
2. Process and store
3. Transmit and receive
A sensor alternates a period of activity and a period of inactivity (*defining a duty cycle*): during the inactivity the energy consumption is very low but the process, radio and I/O need to be freezed. 
In general, the ***duty cycle*** of a system is defined a the fraction of one period in which the system is active. The radio activities can represent an exception to this, based on the specific activity that need to be carried out even during an inactivity period. 
The duty cycle is commonly expressed as a ratio or as a percentage. An example taken form Arduino is the following one:


![[Pasted image 20230324165412.png]]

The `delay` instruction does not power off any component. The period of activity of this duty cycle is 400 ms, but the duty cycle itself does not guarantee to save energy consumption.
Instead, consider the following code in which we turn off the components:
```C
void loop() { 
// reads the input from analog pin 0:
	turnOn(analogSensor); 
	int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
	turnOff(analogSensor); 
	
	// converts value into a voltage (0-5V):
	float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); 
	
	// transmits voltage over the radio
	turnOn(radioInterface); 
	Serial.println(voltage);
	turnOff(radioInterface);
	
	// waits for next loop 
	idle(380); 
}
```
The `turnOn/turnOff` turn on/off a given components and the `idle` isntruction puts the processor in idle state with low power consumption for `y` ms. The `idle` instruction allows to do not power-off the processor but to obtain a duty cycle that by firing a call when the `y` ms are passed, the processor can return operative. 

The code defines 3 different duty cycles, one for each component. 
![[Pasted image 20230324171110.png]]

The duty cycles allows to define or compute the current absorbed by each component based on the general state:
![[Pasted image 20230324171214.png]]
The battery gives a given amount of power but part of the energy if lost even without plugging it: it estimates to 3% per year on the total provided energy. This also have an impact on the charge of the battery that decrease overtime.

#### Example 2
The first model have a 100% DC so it's always fully active while the model 2 have a 5% DC as listed here:
![[Pasted image 20230324171652.png]]

Another way of visualizing them:
![[Pasted image 20230324171858.png]]
The sum of two different activity period form a duty cycle: in the figure there is only indicated a single period.


#### Measuring energy
Energy and power are mesured in Joule $J$ and Watt $W$, respectively $1J = 1W *sec$ 
In electromagnetism, $1W$ is the work performed when a current of $1A$ (Ampere) flows through an electrical potential difference of $1V$ volt, so:
					$1W = 1V * 1A$
Since we use direct current and the electrical potential difference is almost constant, the poewr and the energy only depend on the current (*Ampere*). 
Hence we can express both the energy stored in a battery and the energy consumed in $mAh$ (*milli-Ampere per hour*).

##### Example on computing consumption per duty cycle
Consider two different models in which each component the Duty Cycle *(DC)* the component follows the percentage here presented:
![[Pasted image 20230327151219.png]]
Note that the first model have a Duty Cycle of 100% so it's an always up system while the second model present a Duty Cycle of 5%.

To compute the energy total cost we must first compute the energy cost of each component, considering its duty cycle period.

The **energy cost of a microprocessor $E_{\mu}$ *per cycle*** can be expressed as:
	$E_{\mu} = C_{\mu}^{full}*dc_{\mu} + C_{\mu}^{idle}*(1-dc_{\mu})$
where:
- $C_{\mu}^{full}$ full energy cost microprocessor 
-  $C_{\mu}^{idle}$ idle energy cost microprocessor 
- $dc_{\mu}$ % duty cycle microprocessor
The $C_{\mu}^{idle}$ cannot be dropped because it's multiplied with a factor that is not neglectible ($1-dc_{\mu}$).
The **energy cost radio $E_{\rho}$ *per cycle*** can be expressed as:
$E_{\rho} = C_{\rho}^{T}*dc_{\rho}^{T}+ C_{\rho}^{R}*dc_{\rho}^{R} + C_{\rho}^{idle}*(1-dc_{\rho}^{T}-dc_{\rho}^{R})$
where:
- $C_{\rho}^{T}$ radio transmission energy cost 
-  $C_{\rho}^{R}$radio receival energy cost 
- $C_{\rho}^{idle}$ idle energy cost 
- $dc_{\rho}^{T}$ % transmit duty cycle radio
- $dc_{\rho}^{R}$ % receive duty cycle radio
The **energy cost logger $E_{\lambda}$ and sensor borad $E_{\sigma}$** can be calculated as before, obtaining the **total energy cost per duty cycle** of:
$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\lambda} + E_{\sigma}$
The **lifetime**, expressed in number of duty cycles, is:
					$Lifetime = \frac{B_{0} - L}{E}$
where $B_{0}$ is the initial battery charge and $L$ is the battery charge lost during the lifetime due to **battery leaks** and $E$ is the total cost of energy. Because $L$ depends on lifetime and it's based on charge/loss cycle $\epsilon$, we can obtain a recurrence equation:
				$B_{n} = B_{n-1}*(1-\epsilon) - E$
where $B_{n}$ is the battery charge at cycle $n$. By solving the recurrence equation we obtain that:
			$B_{n} = B_{0}*(1-\epsilon)^{n-1} + \frac{E((1-\epsilon)^{n})-1}{\epsilon}$
The device lifetime is given by $n$, when $B_{n} = 0$.     
Regarding the two models already cited, we can plot both the battery life (*expressed in months*) and the battery capacity (*expressed in milli-Ampere per hour*):
![[Pasted image 20230327151650.png]]
The previous graph show how the second model that have 5% of DC have a longer battery life than the first-one, thanks to longer duration of idle state of its components. The graph, which in expressed in logarithmic scale, show how enlarging the battery capacity the correspondent battery life for the first model is limited to a couple of days while for the second model the battery life can last up to some months. 
![[Pasted image 20230327151825.png]]

The second graph show that given two devices, increase the DC corresponds to a decrease of the lifetime battery. To obtain an efficient device, it's necessary to work on the DC to minimize it and obtain a longer battery life. 

To gain *energy efficiency* the solution is to reduce the *Duty Cycles (DC)*, however ***turning off the processor is a local decision*** so the node scheduler knows that are the activires and when the processor should run. Also, turning offthe radio is a **global decision** that implies no communication, no reception of incoming messages/commands and the impossibility to act as a router in multihop network: this can disrupt the network, dismantling the servie offered. Some methods for avoid this problem is using coordination mechanisms with other devices. 

At **MAC Layer**, MAC Protocols arbitrate the access to the shared communcation channel: in IoT also implements strategies for energy efficiency like **synchronize the devices** and **turn off the radio when it's not needed** (*so excluding the device from the network*).

![[Pasted image 20230327101932.png]]
### Answer

2. ![[Pasted image 20230508152346.png]]
L

2. Compute the expected lifetime of the device
lifetime = 2k mAh/1,243 = 1609 (numb. of houurs)


### Exercise 2
Consider the sensor specification in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230328161140.png]]

The device measures the hearth-rate (HR) of a person: 
- Samples a photo-diode on the wrist at 20 Hz 
	- sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms 
	- it requires both the processor and the sensor active 
- HR is computed every 2 s (based on 40 samples) 
- Transmit (from time to time… see below) a data packet to the server: 
	- The average time required to transit is 2 ms 
	- Requires both processor and radio active
Compute the energy consumption and the lifetime of the device if it sends all the samples to a server: 
- Stores 5 consecutive samples from the photodiode 
- Transmits the stored 5 samples to the server 
- The server computes HR (hence the device does not compute HR)
Disregard battery leaks.


#### Solution 2
**Duty cycle of sampling**: DC of processor + sensors: 0.5 milliseconds (sampling time) / 0.05 seconds  = (sampling period)= 0.01

**Duty cycle of transmitting**: DC of radio + processor: 2 milliseconds (transmit time) / 0,25 seconds (transmission period) = 0.008

Sensor power consumption: 
	$E_{\mu} = 5 mAh * 0,01+ 5 uAh *0,99 =0,05+0,005 mAh = 0,055 mAh$
Processor power consumption:
	$E_{\rho}=0,018*8 mAh + 0,982*15 uAh =0,144+0,0147 mAh = 0,1587 mAh$
Radio power compsution:
	$E_{\lambda}=0,008*20 mA + 0,99992*20\mu A = 0.16 mA + 0.0198 mA = 0.1799 mAh$

$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\lambda}$ 
Battery specification (*in table*) $B_{0} = 2000mAh$
Power consumption: $2000 mAh / 0,3935 mAh$     $(\frac{B_{0}}{E})$
	obtaining **Lifetime**:  $5082 h$

The period of sampling is a strict reqirement (20 Hz): sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms and require both the processor and the sensor active.
The HR is computed every 2s (based on 40 samples)

### Exercise 3
Consider the sensor specification in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230328162514.png]]
The device measures the hearth-rate (HR) of a person: 
- Samples a photodiode on the wrist at 20 Hz
	- sampling the sensor takes 0.5 ms 
	- it requires both the processor and the sensor active 
- HR is computed every 2 s (based on 40 samples)
	- Computing HR in the device takes 5 ms 
- Transmit a data packet to the server: 
	- The average time required to transmit is 2 ms 
	- Requires both processor and radio active
Compute the energy consumption and the lifetime of the device if it computes HR itself:
- Transmits every 5 values of HR computed (1 packet every 10 seconds)
Disregard battery leaks

### Solution 3
 Duty cycle of sampling:    0,5 milliseconds (sampling time) / 0,05 seconds (sampling period)= 0,01
- Duty cycle of processing: 5 milliseconds / 2 seconds = 0,0025 
- Duty cycle of transmitting: 2 milliseconds (transmit time) / 10 seconds (transmission period) = 0,0002

- Power consumption of sensor (in 1h): 
	- $E_{\mu} = 5 mAh * 0,01+ 5 uAh *0,99 =0,05+0,005 mAh = 0,055 mAh$
- Power consumption of processor (1h): 
	- $E_{\rho} = 8 mAh * 0,0127+ 15 uAh *0,9873 =0,1016+0,0148 mAh = 0,1164 mAh$
- Power consumtpion of radio (1h): 
	- $E_{\theta} = 0,0002 *20mAh + 0,9998 *20uAh = 0,004 + 0,02 mAh = 0,024 mAh$

		$E = E_{\mu} + E_{\rho} + E_{\theta}$ = $0.1954 mAh$
Battery specification (*in table*) $B_{0} = 2000mAh$
Power consumption: $2000 mAh / 0,1954 mAh$     $(\frac{B_{0}}{E})$
- Lifetime: $2000 mAh / 0,1954 mAh = 10.235 h$
