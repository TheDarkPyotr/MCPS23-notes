# Case Study: Biologging

The direct observation with sensors are actuated based on miniaturized devices attached on free-range animals:
- **Botelemetry**: collected data/signals that are immediately sent to a remote station by means of wireless interface (storage)
- **Bio-logging**: collected data/signals are stored in an internal memory. Researcher need to physically retrieve the device access to data.
The **activity recognition** aims at automatically recognizing the actions of an animal from the sgnal collected during its activity.


## Device perspective
It uses a low power logger that produces a huge amount of time-series data. Two alterantive can be followed:
1. **Communicate** the time-series data to a remote station
2. **Retrieve** the logger to download the time-serie data. The memory need to be downloaded when full.

The problem of both approach are:
1. Incur in higher consumption
2. Retrieve the stored data is highly intrusive

A novel approach embed the **AI autoamtic classifier on-board** by using a low power microprocessoor. It stores only the result of the classification so being memory efficient and transmit only the results of the classificaton, efficiently affect the communication.

## Tortoises case study
Based on paper *"Barbuti R., Chessa S., Micheli A., and Pucci R.; “Localizing tortoise nests by neural networks”; PloS One 2016."*
Protection programs of tortoises aim at retrieving the eggs and bringing them at a protection center, where hatchlings are protected during their most vulnerable period. The identification of **tortoise nests** in wild is usually very challenging, as tortoises are extremely good in hiding them.
The projects designed a system which automtes the identification of the *digging activty* of *female tortoises* in real time and communicates the GPS location to a remote station and retrieve the eggs that need to be carried to a protected location. 
![[Pasted image 20230331163227.png]]
The oscillary movement of a tortoise is performed by the two back legs: detecting this specific movement allows to derive the execution of the ability, also because the duration of digging lasts a couple of hours. It's also performed in hot and lit locations, at specific sun hours.
Tortoises lay eggs in spring (over 4 months) and a single tortoise may lay eggs more than once (generally up to three/four times). Nesting happens at daytime, in warm and well-lit places. Nesting lasts for more than one hour and the tortoises digs their nests with their hind paws.
Those considerations impacted the design of the device as follows:
- The device lifetime must be at least 4 months 
- Digging activity indicates a probable nesting: it can be detected with accelerometers
- Use of environmental sensors (light and temperature) to limit the use of accelerometers
To detect the motion, an accelometer is used: it's specific for small movements, measuring the tortoise x-axis inclination by measuring the gravity at each movement (*both left and right*). The accelerometer need to sample with a certain frequency, compromising the overall energy consumption: the combination with light sensor and temperature allows to be active only when the environmental conditions are met for the digging, reducing the duty cycle. It's not really important to detect the digging activity from the start but can be a some delay due to its duration (*couple of hours*).

The automata start from the first step with a short duty cycle. The second step perform relevation with a certain frequency, lessser than the first one. The frequency it's suitable for allows the detection algorithms to work. The step 3 allows to avoid false positives, certifying the actual digging activity: if confirmed the GPS data are transmitted.

The diagram implies having different duty cycles that allows to decrease to a minimum the energy consumption: this allows also to estimate the size battery.

### Dataset 1
Initial dataset consists of **raw time-series** from accelerometer (*x axis*) with a MicaZ device that were used for training and test sets. 
The **sequences dataset** was a sequences of 300 seconds with 1Hz sampling: the experiment obtained 126 sequences in total with positive and negative classification, with 56 sequences in the test set, the others for training and validation.

The **pattern dataset** (*that identify the repetitive action of a tortoise*) was composed of sequences of 90 seconds each, sampled at 1Hz. The experimentation obtained 67 patterns with positive classification and 67 negative for model selection, with 10 patterns with positive classification and 10 negative for model validation.

The size of *window of signals* depends on the shape of the *digging* activity signal:
![[Pasted image 20230401153511.png]]

Different approach were considered (SVM, CNN, ESN, IDNN, etc). Two different approach between them:
- **Asynchronous tasks**: classification of single windows: IDNN, CNN, SVM, ESN. The output of the neural network depends on an ***entire window of signal***. 
- **Synchronous tasks**: classification in step by step across a ***stream of data*** (ESN mainly). The output of the neural network does not need an entire window of samples. It is based on the samples of the *last 90 seconds (sufficient to find a pattern)*.*

The results obtained with **asynchronous tasks** are pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230401153946.png]]
The data shows how SVM have medium performances but have an high memory overhead (*to keep weights and other parameters in memory*): considered a device (*Arduino*) with $32kB$ of flash memory, the SVM was the worst choice in term of storage. 

Differently, for **syncrhonous tasks** that worked only on the last retrieved sample in the last 90 seconds, the result were optimal on *ESN - Echo State Network*:

#### Energy Efficiency
The energy efficiency was gained by embedding other choices in the design phase, involving the specific activity of the device and the purpose of the data collection, like:
1. Avoiding sampling at night hours
2. Environmental condition can be sampled at very low rate (*like $0.01Hz$*)
3. Acceleration sample reach higher rate (*5 minutes at $1Hz$*) only when environmental condition are suitable
4. If the response is negative can suspend for at least half an hour because digging of a nest lasts at least one hour or more
5. If the response is positive then: repeat 3x the acceleration sampling and analysis three, reduces the impact of false positives
6. If the device is sure the tortoise is excavating then transmit: this allows to limits the number of radio activations and transmission to a few times over several months

In term of memory, two main **data structure** were used:
- One to store the activity recognition machine, either: vectors of the SVM or weights of the neural networks
One to store the acceleration samples: in the worst case only one window of *300 samples*. One single sample was 2 bytes, so $300*2B= 600 Bytes$

Even **cloud based processing** was consired, giving this scenario:
- **Store (and transmit) GPS** position every half an hour (*two long, 32 bits each*)
- **Store (and transmit) the acceleration data** sampled at $1Hz$ (*10 bits each sample*)
For 4 months continuously: $46 KBytes$ (*GPS*) + $13 Mbytes$ (*accelerometer*)

Differently, with **local processing**:
- **Transmit GPS position**: 32 bits latitude, 32 bits longitude only when detected excavation. Occurs only a few times in 4 months (*not all excavations conclude with nesting*)
- **Storage**: the accelerometer data would be at most $3 KBytes$ (*a time window*), even less with ESN and the GPS would be active only when detects excavation.

To conclude the presented use cases, the *raw accelerometer series* were combined with ML Models to guarantee the catching movement executed by tortoises.

For the **asynchronous task**:
- Short sequence of 300 values (five minutes);
-  IDNN, CNN, ESN and SVM;
- IDNN LRF PF and CNN obtain the same performance (*95% accuracy*), but with different memory overhead, IDNN 0.3KB and CNN 3.5KB.

For the **synchronous task**:
- First time that the ESN are applied for identifying animal activities;
- The model reached high performance in accuracy (93%);

For both types of tasks, an high accuracy was obtained with a neural network with a few neurons (*5 neurons*).


#### Exercise 1
Assume this scenario:
- Biologging device for tortoises with $512 KB$ of storage memory
- Uses one-axis accelerom. sampled at a frequency $f$
- Each sample is converted by the ADC (*Analogic-Digital Converter*) into a $16$ bit integer
- The application stores all accelerom. data in memory. If memory is full the data is lost
- The herpetologist retrieves the device and classify offline the activities of the tortoise
Estimate the lifetime of the application: for lifetime, in this context, we refer to the **time elapsed from start to the time in which the storage is full**. (*Note: disregard energy consumption and battery capacity*).

##### Solution 1


Lifetime = 256K/f seconds
if f = 1Hz, 73 hours


#### Exercise 2
Same as the previous exercise, but the application processes the data:
- analyses a sequence of 5 seconds of accelerometer data 
- for each sequence, it produces a classification of the activity of the tortoise encoded into 2 bits: 
	- $00$ (sleep); 
	- $01$ (walk); 
	- $10$ (eat); 
	- $11$ (nest)
See example in the table. Compute the lifetime of the device (*defined as in exercise 1*).
![[Pasted image 20230401160525.png]]
##### Solution 2
Every5 sec, the device stores 2 bits in the storage. This means storing 1 byte very 20s. Since the storge contains 512 KB, the lifetime is $512kb*20s$ = 121 days

#### Exercise 3
Same as Exercise 2, but the application stores the activity classification only when it changes:
- if was “walk” and the new one is “walk” then no storage 
- If was “walk” and the new one is “eat” then store “eat” (2 bits) and current time (30 bits). 
An example is pictured in the following table:
![[Pasted image 20230401160622.png]]
As before: memory full implies data lost. Hint: assume that, on average, the activity of the tortoise changes every half an hour.


##### Solution 3
Soluzione: 512Kb / 4*30 = 7.5 years

#### Exercise 4
Consider the device of the Exercise 3: 
- it samples the accelerometer with frequency $f$
- at each sample it computes a new classification and, if changed, it stores it 
Assume that:
- sampling takes $m$ seconds 
- computing the classification and storing it takes $n$ seconds 
Compute the duty cycle of the device. 


##### Solution 4
The devices execute the sampling every 1/f seconds. Hence the period of activity is: p = 1/f seconds
In each period it spends n+m sec to sample, compute and store
- 1/f - m -n seconds, in idle state.

Duty cycle: ((n+m)/p)

must be that 1/f >= n+m
