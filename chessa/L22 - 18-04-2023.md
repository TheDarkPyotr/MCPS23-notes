# Embedded programming
We can define *embedded systems* as a combination of hardware, software and mechanical component. Mainly they're based on a microcontroller: it's a chip that embeds a microprocessor, memory, IO interfaces and optmized mechanism over IO components.
The microcontroller interacts with an electro-mechanical devices to which it provides control. Given this controllimg aim, it foten has *real-time* constraints.

On the market exists different types of microcontrollers, having different processors, memory and guaranteed performance: they can be specific, also known as *ASICs - Application-Speficic Integrated Circuits* or be general purpose, thus adaptive based on the specific application scenario. 
In terms of capacity, those devices are highly limited with a very small memory footprint of about $16kB$ of program memory based on flash memory technology and $8kB$ of SRAM for data. Usually there isn't any type of *file system* thus this features must be provided (*and implemented by libraries*) by the developer itself, detailing the controlling steps of the features.

On this devices usually there aren't any  conventional operating system but they contains only a set of libraries to be able to execute specific functions. During the compilation, those libraries are static linked to our injected code. Different systems, like *RaspberryPi*, have the features of having a full OS.  In this chapter we'll consider of having only devices without an OS.
This implies also that is not possible to write and compile the code directly on the microcontroller but it's necessary to write the code on a full-fledge computer/OS and compile the given code using a *cross-compiler*, specifying at compilation time the type of system on which the code will run and then upload it on device firmware.
The executable file include the user's code, a set of libraries that implement the interconnection with the hardware and mimic the OS functions. Usually the code is written in C both for performance reasons (*mainly being able to manipulate low-level registers*): as explained later, the `main` is provided by the *OS* itself.
This methodology is known as *co-design*, in which both hardware and software are designed and bundled together, without a proper user interface to interact with them.

Based on the specific purpose, when uploading the binary files into the devices can be necessary to add some more information to be able to carry out peculiar function like the *device identifier* to implement *routing functions*. 
This scenario shift the *programming paradigm* usually used on a classical computer: in classic programming we provide a `main` function but in embedding systems the `main` function is provided by the device itself that execute the setup operation, inizialing the device and then activates the task that implement the functionalities specific for the device. Two things are embedded in user's code: the initial device configuration and the code to run at runtime. The first is executed by the `main` function that initialize the specific data structure, than the function calls the user's specific code.
This approach allows to simplify the initialization, without repeating the procedure everytime. 

Usually the software execution on an embedded system is structure as a **loop cycle** (*as a form of duty cycle*) that includes:
- Reading from transducers
- Taking a decision
- Controlling actuators
- Optionally communicating with other devices
Sampling sensors needs regular intervals to work properly (*as we'll see later*).
All these steps are executed in a control loop that is a function invoked by the `main` after device initialization: the user only provide the function to be repeated, the *loop* itself it's embedded in the device control behavior.

Due to it's simplicity, the interaction with hardware at low level happen by the code interacting with the components by means of **commands** and **interrupts**: a *command* activats the hardware component (*e.g. read from a transducer*) while an *interrupt* singals that the command has been executed. T
In parallel with a classical OS syste, the command are available in terms of *system calls* invoked by the user's code: if there is a waiting time, the invoking thread is suspensed. The interrupts are managed by the OS kernel and re-activates the suspended threads, allowing *async event management* due to the thread/process abstraction and the interfaces exposed by the kernel.
So in conventional OS, the programmer's code just see a lirabry stub function that execute the commands and returns a value: the suspension mechanism of a thread is transparent to the use but require also a *stack* (*e.g. TCB*) for each thread to store its context: this approach guarantee asyncronicity, abstracting the passing time between the requested execution and the final result.
For the type of constrained devices we are considering, usually the RAM memory is very small  (*e.g. Arduino 1 had $4kB$ RAM*) that serves for communication buffers, variables and all the basic setup functions of the devices. 
In case of insufficient memory, this devices usually adopts mainly two different strategies: 
1. **Event loop**: single thread that can be suspended but without including thread scheduling. Mainly used in Arduino 1.
2. **Event based programming and task**: manage directly interrupts, implementing event handlers for the actions to be carreid out in response to those events. This model is present in TinyOS but also supported by Arduino.

## Arduino model

The flow process of Arduino is defined in a *single loop function* that may also invoke other functions: the loop is executed by a **single thread**, without suspension thus the I/O makes the thread in waiting until the IO is complete, but without contemplate any thread scheduling. If you want to delay the execution explicitly it's necessary to use delays function in the code itself: this mainly happen to impose a strict time in sampling. The waiting periods does not save energy, as already seen. 

Here is sketched the execution flow in Arduino:

![[Pasted image 20230418100640.png]]
The ordered steps are:
1. The first `init` call is executed by the device itself and it's used to initialize the device to be able to communicate with the hardware components. 
2. At the end of the `init` function, the `main` loop is invoked. This phase contemplates the send of commands to the hardware. When the command has been executed, the Arudino RTS (*Run-Time Support*) signals the end of command communication and return.
3. After the command execution is terminated, the main loop re-activated by the main thread. If the *active workload* is already done, we can explicitly invoke a `delay` function that send a command to a timer, suspending the CPU until the timer reactivates the main loop by firing a signal.

The Arduino simple model fits well with simple sensing and controlling activities, including natively also libraries for actuators. Despite it's not born for communications, recent version includes libraries and HW to support **asyncrhonous event management** (*requiring to manage communications through serial line*) that is as the foundation of communication between devices. Mainly, sensing activities are syncrhonous, while communication and specific sensing are usually asyncrhonous. 

## Case Study: TinyOS

TinyOS hasn't the concept of event loop but was designed to support **synchrhonous management of event** by the means of:
- **Commands**: offers functions to program and activate the hardware: 
- **Events**: it abstract the *interrupts* in form *upcall*, the programmer has to define handler function for each event or use handler function provided by the RTS. 
- **Tasks**: defines **non-preemptive tasks** that are execute sequentially, allowing to manage different independent activities.  When the task execution is terminated and there aren't anymore to execute, the CPU goes in idle mode so avoiding to store the context of a given task.
Still, interrupts should be handled as soon as they arrive by means of an event handler: those events can start a task to perform complex/long computation and can be *pre-empted* **only by events**.  This is done with little overhead using the stack. This is the only exception to task managent and it's mainly due to the fact that:
1. During handler execution it's not possible to receive another interrupt so the second interrupt reception would be delayed
2. The event handler it's not suitable to implement complex task but only to update data structure, thus complex work must be posted as a **task**. 
The event handler should be *as short as possible*, allowing to update data structure and give commands to the HW but if the event management require more work, this work must be post as a **task**, as already said.

![[Pasted image 20230418102218.png]]
The control loop is not provided in the underlying RTS: in the example, the timer handler is invoked when the interrupt *timer* is fired. The handler will stop shortly after sending the *reading* command to the RTS: the result is not immediate but will arrive later after the RTS will notify that the operation is complete (*Read done*).
Upon reception of the readed values, the reader handler is executed and the process is delegated to a task. In the read handler, alongside posting a task, it's necesssary to provide what to do after the task execution and this is done by setting another times. After the task is completed, it sends data (*transmitting the data to other device*, which takes time and it's not immediately performed; when complete will be signaled by the RTS) and then the RTS will signal that the timer fill fire the end signal. 
After a the task is performed, the operations are repeated thanks to the event-handler chain association. The general abstraction is sketched here:
![[Pasted image 20230418120212.png]]
The *interrupt handler* it's only an invokation of the event handler and *must be the simplest one*: it's still possible to invoke a command in the event handler but that command must relate to a different component from which the interrupt was received. Manipulate the same data structure of components from which the interrupt was received can lead to an incosistent state. 
![[Pasted image 20230418120438.png]]This mostly justify the introduction of task event management: this allows to strictly decouple the interrupt handler from the event handler, adding another layer of abstraction.
![[Pasted image 20230418120543.png]]

To support asyncrhonous communcation, Arduino provides an **interrupt** mechanism to be able also to go in *low-power* mode: this allows to avoid to save state of current process. The key idea, explained in detail later, it's that *interrupts* should be handled as soon as they arrive by using event handlers. The event handlers should be as short as possible, allowing to *update data structure, send commands to hardware components (not all components)*, obtaining a model similar to TinyOS's behavior. 

## Case Study: Arduino
Arduino is an **open-source electronics prototyping platform** based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It comrpises three elements: a board, the IDE and the reference forum.

The following board is *Arduino Uno* based on *AVR Arduino microcontroller Atmega328* with:
- SRAM 2KB (data) 
- EEPROM 1KB 
- Flash memory 32 KB (program)
- 14 digital pins (both input and output)
- 6 analog pins (only input)
- other pins for power
The circuit is powered with 6V, so thhe value 1 correspond to 6V/1024. The ADC converts the voltage in 10 bits.
![[Pasted image 20230418122207.png]]

Some terminology:
- "*sketch*": a program you write to run on an Arduino board
- "*pin*": an input or output connected to something. (*e.g. output to an LED, input from a knob*). 
- "*digital*": value is either **HIGH** or **LOW**. (*aka on/off, one/zero*) (*e.g. switch state*) 
- "*analog*": value ranges, usually from 0-1023. (*e.g. LED brightness, motor speed, etc.*)
The **variables** already defined:
- *Constants*:
	- level of energy (`HIGH`, `LOW`)
	- mode of pin (`INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `INPUT_PULLUP`)
	- led13(`LED_BUILTIN`)
- *Types*: word, strings, etc;
- *Variable scope and qualifiers*: `volatile`;
- *Usefulness*: `sizeof()`

The overall *structure* it's based on two functions:
- `void setup(){..}`: called when a sketch start. Will run only once.
- `void loop(){...}`:  user defined code.

The **builtin function** that can be used in `loop()` are:
- **Digital functions**: `pinMode(); digitalRead(); digitalWrite();`
- **Analog functions**: `analogReference(); analogRead(); analogWrite();` 
- **Advanced I/O**: `tone(); noTone(); shiftOut(); shiftIn(); pulseIn();` 
- **Time**: `millis(); micros(); delay(); delayMicroseconds();` 
- **Math/trigonometry**: `min(); max(); abs(); sin(); cos();` 
- **Random Numbers**: `randomSeed(); random();`
- **Bits and Bytes**: `lowByte(); highByte(); bitRead(); bitWrite(); bitSet(); bitClear(); bit();`
- **External Interrupts**: `attachInterrupt() detachInterrupt();`
- **Interrupts**: `interrupts(); noInterrupts();`
- **Communication**: `Serial; Stream;`

Here an example of *analog and digital read*:
```C
// Reads an analog input on pin 0 and converts it to voltage; 
// Reads a digital input on pin 2; 
// When input on pin 2 is high prints voltage in the serial and switches the led. 
const int buttonPin = 2; // the number of the pushbutton pin 
const int ledPin = 13; // the number of the LED pin 
int buttonState = 0; // variable to read the pushbutton status
void setup() { // runs once when you press reset
	Serial.begin(9600); // init serial lineat 9600 bps
	pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // init. the LED pin as an output 
	pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); // init. pushbutton pin as an input
}

void loop() { 
// reads the state of the pushbutton value:
buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); 
if (buttonState == HIGH) { // if the pushbutton is pressed
	digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turns LED on... // ... and reads the input (in [0,1023] on analog pin 0:
	int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Convert analog reading to a voltage (0-5V): 
	float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);
	Serial.println(voltage); // print out the voltage
	} 
	else digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turns LED off 
}
```

#### Exercise
Consider the following fragment of Arduino code:
```C
void loop() { 
		int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
		Serial.println(sensorValue); 
		delay(100);
}
```
Compute its duty cycle assuming that:
- Reading an analog value takes 2 milliseconds
- Transmitting along the serial line takes 5 milliseconds

## Arduino interrupts
As in TinyOS, allows management of asyncrhonous events: this is possible by providing an interfface to manage *interrupts*, allowing async access to sensor data and actuators. There are three types of interrupts:
- **External**: a signal outside, connected to a pin
- **Timer**: internal to Arduino (*e.g. timer feature, managed by RTS*)
- **Device**: an internal signal coming from a device (*ADC, serial line, etc*)
Interrupts are managed by RTS of Arduino. For **external interrupts**, the support is provided by Arduino at run-time by declaring `attachInterrupt(interrupt#, func-name, mode);` in the `setup()` function (*Shown later*). 

Arduino provides only two *external interrupts pins*, respectively $INT0$ and $INT1$ which are mapped to **pins 2 and 3**: they can be set to trigger on `RISING` or `FALLING` signal edges, on `CHANGE` or on `LOW` level. The triggers are interprented by hardware, and the interrupt is very fast. The following are the possible values of `mode` parameter:
- **RISING**: the interrupt occurs when the pin passes from `LOW` to `HIGH` state. (*Shifting from $0V$ to $5V$*). 
- **FALLING**: the interrupt occurs when the pin passes from `HIGH` to `LOW` state 
- **CHANGE**: the interrupt occurs when the pin switches state
- **LOW**: the interrupt occurs whenever the pin has `LOW` state. Not necessary a change of state. If it remains `LOW` the interrupt occurs again 
- **HIGH**: the interrupt occurs whenever the pin has `HIGH` state. Not necessary a change of state. If it remains HIGH the interrupt occurs again.
![[Pasted image 20230418153709.png]]
The connection pictured in the *breadboard* implement:
- A **button** to digital input 2: with 10k$\Omega$ resistor
- A **lead** to digital output 7: with 220$\Omega$ resistor

The code of the two function is the following one:
```C
/** * test interrupt * */ 
volatile int greenLed=7; 
volatile int count=0; 
void setup() { 
	Serial.begin(9600); 
	pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);  //set green light as output
	digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW); //write LOW to digitsal pin 7
	attachInterrupt(0, interruptSwitchGreen,RISING); // 0 because it is pin 2 
}
```
The `Serial.begin(speed)` specify the data rate in bits per second for serial data transmission: the rate must be the same setted in the Serial Monitor so be sure to be able to receive the data at the same rate of emission.

```C
void loop() { 
	count++; 
	delay(1000); 
	// interrupts are received 
	// also within delay!
	Serial.print("waiting:");
	Serial.println(count);
	if ( count == 10 ){ 
		count = 0; 
		digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW); //turn off the green light, resetting the counter
		Serial.println("now off");
	} 
}

void interruptSwitchGreen(){ 
	digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH); //turn on the green light
	count=0;  //reset the counter
	Serial.print("now on");
}
```
The first thing we can notice is that the two variables we define (`greenLed` and `count`) are declared as $volatile$. If you don't declare them as volatile the processor would allocate them in a register but this computer would mean that when one of these variables is updated, the update would have no effect in the loop where it is used (*e.g. count is set to 0 and if it weren't volatile it wouldn't me I would notice*). 
In this way the compiler is forced to store the variable in memory, there is also another variable which is `greenLed` which is volatile even if it has never been written, it is in practice a *constant* and therefore in this case they could also avoid call it volatile.
The code turns on a led which is initially off. In the `setup` code we manage an interruption that when arrive turn on the led, in the `loop` function then this led is only turned off and to turn it off we go to reset a counter.
