## Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR)
*For further considerations refer to [GPSR: Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing for Wireless Networks](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~htk/publication/2000-mobi-karp-kung.pdf)*
Both considering Dijskstra and Distance Vector both have problem as centralized routing algorithms: the first have the problem of matrix representation which is an heavy storage burden, the second have problem of knowing the address of each consecutive node to be able to route the packet on the right path.

*GPSR* it's an alternative to Direct Diffusion and similar protocols that allows to route packets node-to-node without mantaining a global state and having a low overhead.
This is true under some assumptions:
- Nodes are located in a bi-dimensional space
- Nodes knows their location and the location of their neighbors
- Source node knows the destination node and its position

GRPS exploit GPS, using geographical position to address individual nodes: you can communicate only with physical neighbors and the naming identification it's performed by a given geographical order.
GPSR enable arbitrary point-to-point communication which Direct Diffusion does not support.

GPSR reduce also the burden on nodes: simplify the routing protocol respect, for example, to link protocols already mentioned, without having the wide knowledge of the network to forward data. The protocol is *strongly localized*, operating only on local knowledge thus reducing the overall storage of information to operate.


#### Overview
GPSR work using two type of mode:
- **Greedy forwarding**: forward the packet to one of your neighbors so the neighbor pick up the next node closer to the destination.
- **Perimeter forwarding**: support the first mechanism to operate. When there is no point to progress further toward the destination $D$ thus greedy mode fails and the protocol switch to perimeter mode. It identify the perimeter of the **void** region by traversing the perimeter along, circumnavigating the perimeter to discover nodes connected to the network, allowing to advance towards $D$. 

For the *Greedy Forwarding* mode, consider a packet with destination $D$: the forwarding node $x$ selects as next hop a neighbor $y$ such that:
- $y$ is closer to $D$ than $x$ (*guarantee optimality*)
- among neighbors, $y$ is the closest to the destination $D$ (*guarantee to advance distance to $D$, avoiding local optimum*). 
The greedy forwarding fails when falls in a region where there isn't a sensor to forward or a **void**, in an empty area, so this mode alone does not provide reliability. 

Consider the following example:
![[Pasted image 20230523144654.png]]
Here the node $x$ switch to the *perimeter mode* to route to $w$: makes sense to keep in **perimeter mode** until we are in node that in greedy mode is capable of making progress towards D respect to the previous node.
So we switch to *greedy mode* when the node $x$ have'nt any neighbors closer to $D$ more than the selected node.
During the perimeter mode the node $x$ identify the nodes that are on the border of the void region in which the destination node $D$ is founded, forwarding the packet to them to circumnavigate the region.

Consider the following schema:
![[Pasted image 20230523150219.png]]

In this scenario,  the source node is $x$ and the destination is still node $D$: we need to forward on the path $y \rightarrow u \rightarrow z \rightarrow v \rightarrow w \rightarrow t \rightarrow D$. 
It's necessary to understand when switch back to greedy mode, for example when the packet is forwarded to $z$: switch to greedy mode in $z$ would mean creating a loop because packets would be forwarded back to $u$ which is geographically closer to $D$ respect to $z$. 
In this scenario, the perimeter mode is mantained until the node $w$ is reached thus the node $t$ is switched back to greedy node and $D$ is reached.

The general rule to switch from the *perimeter mode* to the *greedy mode* is that: "**GPSR switch back to greedy mode when it found a node that is closer to destination D respect to a node $x$ that firstly switched to perimeter mode**".
Applied to the previous example, the node $w$ is aware that the node $t$ is closer to $D$ respect to $x$, (*where $x$ previously switched from greedy mode to perimeter mode*), thus $w$ switch again to the greedy mode.


It's **implicitly safe** the switch back from perimeter mode to greedy mode because we ensure the progress with the perimeter mode exploration. 
When $x$ began the perimeter mode add its location to the **header of the packet**, alongisde other information to keep properly the perimeter mode. This information are used to switch back from one mode to another (see later). 

### Perimeter mode
To implement the perimeter mode is necessary to identify the nodes alongside the *void area* by exploiting only the local information and routes around the void: the exchange with the local neighbors allows to identify the nodes on the perimeter.
It's based on *Right Hand Rule (RHR)* or equivalently *Left Hand Rule (LHR)*: when arriving from $y$ to $x$ selects the first **counterclockwise edge** from $(x,y)$ and traverses the interior of a **closed polygonal region** (*or face*) in clockwise order.
Imagine starting from $y$, using *RHR* arrive to node $x$ and apply again the *RHR* from the outgoing edges of $x$ to reach $z$. 
![[Pasted image 20230523151747.png]]
This methods allows to explores the edge of the polygon enclosing the void region.

The algorithm works only if the underlying graph of the network topology is **planar**: the WSN's graph are mostly not planar so edges may *cross* and the *RHR* may take a *degenerate tour* that does not trace the boundary of a *closed polygon*.

In the example, from $x$ to $v$ the *RHR* produce the path:
$x-v-w-u-x$

(**footnote**: *Differently, in Direct Diffusion the DAG is directed based on the sink position thus there are not constrained on the real network topology that leads to geometric-planar ploblem*).

### Graph Planarization
We cannot assume that the network topoogy is **planar**: the solution is to enforce the planarity to the network topology graph representation. 
We can build a planar network topology exploiting local information by using:
- **Relative Neighborhood Graph of G (RNG) **
- **Gabriel Graph of G (GG)** 
They both create a *subgraph of a given graph*, without adding link but only removing.
They mantains some properties: if $G$ is connected then the produced planarized graph $P$ is connected and it's obtained by removing edges from $G$.
Secondly, they execute a localized, distributed knowledge discover to identify the edge of the graph, this is possbile because every node have executed the planarization of the graph in advanced so minimizing the memory and computation overhead.

Starting from the obtained graph $P$, *GPSR* uses the *greedy mode* on all links but limit the *perimeter mode* only on the links *preserved in the planarized graph $P$*.

#### Relative Neighborhood Graph
The edge $(u,v) \in P \iff  (u,v) \in G$ 
and
$d(u,v) \leq max_{\forall w \in N(u)\cup N(v)}(d(u,w),d(w,v))$
Consider node $u$: for each neighbor $v \in N(u)$, edge $(u,v)$ is kept if and oly if the area between the node $u$ and $v$ is empty.
![[Pasted image 20230523153320.png]]


If we have a node in the *empty zone*, we can remove the ray $(u,v)$ because the connectivity is preserved by this node that act as a form of *bridge* between $u$ and $v$ (*assuming circular transmission range to both u and v*). So RNG **cut long links**, preferring shorter links that preverse connectivity. 

#### Gabriel Graph
The edge $(u,v) \in P \iff  (u,v) \in G$ 
and
$d(u,v)^{2} \leq d(u,w)^{2}+d(w,v)^{2} \forall w \in N(u) \cup N(v)$.
Consider node $u$: for each neighbor $v \in N(u)$, edge $(u,v)$ is kept if and oly if the area between the node $u$ and $v$ is empty.


![[Pasted image 20230523153953.png]]
The Gabriel Graph $P$ is built with a distributed algorithms and keeps more links of the original graph respect to *RNG*, thus RNG is a subgraph of GG. Also, GG works better with GPRS because provide a graph with shorter perimeters.

#### GPSR with graph planarization
A planar graph has two types of faces:
- **Interior faces**: closed polygonal regions bounded by the graph edges
- **One exterior face**: unbounded face outisde the outer boundary of the graph
This two concepts will result useful when describing the delivery mechanism in GPSR considering the graph's faces.
![[Pasted image 20230523155042.png]]


The line $x$ to $D$ allows to identify the faces of the graph, identify also its other two neighbors along the $F_{1}$ border.
In the perimeter mode the packet will reach the second red node,at the intersection with $x-D$ line and $L_{f}$: from this node onward we switch the graph face from $F_{1}$ to $F_{2}$ thus the packet is sent to all nodes alongisde $F_{2}$ border until it reaches a nodethat is closer to $D$ respect to $x$, switching back to greedy mode.

So more formally:
- In each of the faces GPSR uses the right hand rule (*RHR*) to reach an edge that intersects with the $x-D$ line and that is closer to $D$ than $x$.
- At that edge GPSR moves to the adjacent face crossed by $x-D$ line
- Each time the packet enters a new face then we store both the intersection point  $L_{f}$ with the $x-D$ line and the edge that is currently being used, alongside $e_{0}$ that is the first edge crossed in the new face.
GPSR returns to **greedy mode** if the current node is closer to $D$ than $x$, so the **perimeter mode** is only intended to recover from a *local maximum*.  
In *perimeter mode* the packet header contains:
![[Pasted image 20230523163147.png]]
where $x$ is the node where the packet enters in the *perimeter mode* and considering the segment $x-D$, GPSR forwards the packet on progressively closer faces on the planar graph, each of which intersects $x-D$.

The rule of finding the intersection and then moving on to the next face is not used too often, this is because there is an **aggressive policy** for switching from perimeter mode to greedy mode and then we switch to greedy mode when the node we reach is closer to the destination with respect to $x$.

The node forward the packet alongside the faces of the graph, switching back to greedy mode only when the distance of the node that started the perimeter node is longer than the actual node distance.

##### Delivery failure
![[Pasted image 20230523163539.png]]
(*Caption: delivery failure with $D$ inside the face $F_{3}$*)
Considering the graph faces, there are two cases in which the destination node $D$ is not reachable:
- $D$ lies inside an interior face $F_{i}$: referring the image, the packet tour aroud face $F_{3}$ and when crosses the *red node* picture it's dropped.
- $D$ lies inside the *exterior fce* $F_{e}$: the packet will reach the face by making a tour around the entire border of the graph, until it passes again through the node that started the *perimeter node* so at that point the packet is dropped and the delivery fail.


### Simulations
The dynamic of the network (*node mobility, joining nodes, etc*) leads to *performance degradation*: performing planarization at each topology variation implies an high overhead of recomputing the graph $P$.
An approach to avoid performance degradation consists in nodes that periodically communicate their position to neighbors (***beaconing***) to allows adjacent neighbors to mantain a *neighbor's list*. 

The paper shows that when the performance degrade over a certain threshold the planazation must be re-executed, despite the *beaconing mechanism*: data shows that decreasing the beaconing interval improves the *deliery rate*, and that sparse network can represent a problem due to a shortage of allowed paths.

#### Drawback
Planarization can be unprecised or even fail in case of **unidirectional links**, **obstacles** or *non-circular trasmission ranges*:
#todo make images side-by-side
![[Pasted image 20230523164730.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230523164756.png]]
For the obstacle scenario, the node $u$ is aware of node $w$ so will not consider the edge $(u,v)$ but  $v$ is not able to identify node $w$  thus the **planarization** will only consider two links: $u-w$ and $v-u$, producing a graph with unidirectional links.

An incorrent graph planarization can lead GPSR to fail by triggering a loop in which the algorithm is applied to unidiretional link, as in the following figure:
![[Pasted image 20230523165604.png]]
Here the problem is the link between the node $u$ and $x$ because $x$ will not see $v$ in its neighbors list, while $u$ will see $v$ as neighboard and will not consider the link to $x$ (*no outgoing edges, only incoming because it's unidirectional*). The packet from the source, following *RHR* will flow through $u-v-w-x-u$, forming a loop because $u$ is closer to $D$ respect to $x$, under $x$ loca view. 


The solution to this problem is known as *Mutual Witness* that represent an extension of the planarization algorithm. The description of this solution is outside the scope of this notes.

## ZigBee Network Layer
EODV: allows to support mobility for small net (see corbucci #todo)

ZigBee NL address the problem of initializing the network and assigning the addresses, considering an autonomous network without intervention (*node join using a not already used address*) thus is necessary to have a global agreement with the available addresses on a central registry.
This mechanism complex thhe joining process: the new node ocmmunicate with the neighbor's node and the central registry is mantained by the coordinator that can be very distant, thus to have assigned the address can take very long time.
This mechanism can work alongside the device discovery features that is *involuntary* and not explicit respect to the *joining* activity.


When boostrapping the network, still considered as a tree, we can specify the parameters:
- three dept
- maximum children per router
- maximum ... #todo 
The rules implictly defined by those parameters recurisvely applied to each children of the coordinator (id 0).
When a node reaches the maximum dept of the three it cannot have other children.
This mechanism allows to pre-define the set of the addresses to be assigned to joining nodes: in advance we already know the size of a given subtree (*knowing the max dept and number of children per node*) thus we can allocate the addresses range for each sub-tree.
The range assignation is performed trhgho DFS, considering sub-nodes children routers range as previously.
This joining process forbid to have address duplication.

![[Pasted image 20230523172036.png]]


At network layer we can also define the specific type of **routing protocol** that ZigBee can use:
- *Broadcasting*
- *Tree routing*
- *Mesh routing*
The last two types are for *point-to-point* communication.

#### Tree routing
Given the following scenario:
![[Pasted image 20230524141226.png]]

The node $3$ that want to communcate with node $25$ must forward the packet to node $2$ because is his father. The node 25 is outisde of node 2's range so the packet will be forwarded to node $1$ and again to node 0 which is the root node. The packet will be forwarded to 14 and then to node 25.
All those communciation happen between routers, except the final one that is between the router 14 and the end-device 25: for the last hop, the node 14 can advertise the node 25 of the presence of a new message in its beacon message, so the ndoe 25 will request the message itself to node 14. 


#### Mesh routing
It's based on *AODV protocol* (*which is not in the scope of the following notes*): the key idea is that each router have its own routing table, mantaining destination, next hop and a set of information about the path to a specific node.


![[Pasted image 20230524141323.png]]
If the communication happen between the node 3 and node 25, the source node will verify that the destination exists in an entry of its routing table: if the entry does not exists, a **path discovery** operation is triggered. 
The path discovery operation exploit the *broadcast* method, containing the *request ID* and the *path cost*, initialized to 0: the request is propagated inside the network so each intermediary router can answer if an entry with the target destination is found in one of the node's routing table.
