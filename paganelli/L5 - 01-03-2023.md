## IEEE 802.11
The IEEE 802.11 identify a protocol family: each release is identified by a subsequent letter. The firstone was the legacy mode and rarely used: was at 1-2 Mbps data rate implemented via Infrared signals with a radio frequencies in the `2.4 GHz` band (*as frequency range*). Subsequent releases were:
- `802.11a` : operate at 5GHz band with a throughtput of 23 Mbps and data rate of 54 Mbps. 
- `802.11b` : operate at 2.4GHz but poses a problem of interference with other appliances (*cordless telephones, microwave, etc*). Had a throughput of 4.3 Mbps and data rate maximum of 11 Mbps.
- `802.11g` : 
- `802.11n` : operate at 2.4GHz band and 5GHz 
	It support **MIMO** technologies for using multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver
- `801.11ac - WiFi 5`
- `801.11ax - WiFi 6` 
To summarize:
![[Pasted image 20230301162952.png]]
All of those use *CSMA/CS* for Multiple Access and have base-station (*infrastructure*) and ad-hoc network versions (*implementing function to access the medium, see previous)*. With lower frequencies we have longer wave length: it suitable for IoT sensors. Despite the max dara rate is not huge remains suitable for transmitting data. 

We ca have also different implementation at **data link layer** of both **MAC sublayer** and **Logical Link control*:

#### Architecture
A group of stations operating under a coordination function may or may not use a *base station* or *Access Point (AP)*. 
If using AP a station communicates with another by channeling all the traffic through a centralized AP: so AP provide connectivty with other APs and other groups of stations via fixed infrastructure. 
It can also suppoer *ad hoc networks* by introducing a *group of stations that are under the direct control of a single coordination function without the aid of an infrastructure network*. 

### Channel association
The spectrum of a mean is divided into channel at different frequencies: the AP admin chooses the frequency for AP. At this level the interference is possible because channels can be same as that chosen by neigboruing AP.

A new host must be associated with an **AP**: first it scan the channel frequencies and listen for *beacon frames* (*like a sort of hello frame, advertise device on the device on the same frequency and sended by the AP*). The beacon frame contains the name of the network (SSID) and MAC address of AP (BSSID).
The node select one AP to associate and perform authentication (if needed) and then run the DHCP protocol to get IP address in the AP's subnet. 

#### Active/Passive scanning
AP periodically sends beacons frames on their frequency: the node when arrived detect beacons frame and select AP. Nodes select the AP and send the association request. 
The choose of the AP made by nodes is not mandatorial descripted in the specific: usually is selected the AP with the best **signal strenght** that also is indicative of the number of communication opened by AP with other nodes so is a measure of quality/disponibility of resources.
The **passive scanning** flows as following:
1. Beacon frames sent from APs
2. association request frame sent so *H1* to selected AP
3. Association Response frame sent: selected AP to H1

The **Active scanning** flows:
1. Probe Request frame broadcast from H1
2. Probe Response frames sent from APs
3. Association request frame sent: H1 to selected AP
4. Association Response frame sent from selected AP to H1

#### MAC Sublayer
![[Pasted image 20230301165125.png]]
- **Point Coordination Function (PCF)** : uses base station to control all activity in its cell. AP poolls stations for transmission. It's based on DCF. 
- **Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)**: used for contention services, is based on MACA.

**DCF** must be implemnted by all stations: it's completely decentralized and use a best affort asyncronous traffic. Stations must contend for the channel at each frame using CSMA/CA.
  *Carrier sensing* is performed at two levels:
  - *Physical*: by checking the frequency to determine whether the medium is in use or not. It detect an incoming signal and any activty in the channels due to other sources.
  - *Virtual*: is performed by seding a duration information in the header of an RTS, CTS and data frame. So keeps the channel *virtually busy* up to the end of data frame transmission.
A channel is marked **busy** if either the physical or the virtual carrier sensing indicate busyness. 

**Priority access** to the medium is controlled through the use of **interframe space (IFS)** time intervals. The IFS is a mandatory periods of idle time on the transmission medium. 

Three IFS specified by the standard:
- *Short (SIFS)*:
- *Point Coordination Function (PIFS)*: 
- *Distributed Coordination Function IFS (DIFS)*:
The hierarchical order based on priority is given by:
						`SIFS < PIFS < DIFS`
![[Pasted image 20230301182340.png]]
The exchange of RTS and CTS between sender and receiver allows the other nodes to calculate the *NAV (Network Access Vector)* that is an **estimation of duration** of communciation between sender and receiver (*a sort of period of silence to avoid illegal accesses to the mean*) 

## Mobile Networks
Nowadays there are more mobile-broadband-connected deviced than fixed-broadband. the 4G-5G cellular network now embrace internet protocol stack, including SDN.
There are two important different challenges:
- *Wireless*:
- *Mobility*: handling the mobile user who changes point of attachment to network or by the provider that wants advertise a service It also poses authentication and authorization problems towards user requested services. 


#### Components of cellular network architecture
![[Pasted image 20230301172546.png]]
The *MSC* intermediate the connection betwwen different cells sets of networks, it also manage the billing information by tracking times and call setup.
MSC can manage more than 4 cells or *base station*: some MSC can be also used as gateway to the *wired-telephone network*. 

![[Pasted image 20230301172950.png]]
From 4G to 5G we have a change in the architecture, integrating software engineering choices in new components like supporting orchestration and function virtualization (*More at https://doi.org/10.3390/en12112140*). 

With the evolution of mobile network technology both evolves with the *access techniques*:
![[Pasted image 20230301173232.png]]

#### FDMA/TDMA
*Frequency Division Multiplexing Access/Time Division Multiplexing Access* are two techniques used for **sharing mobile-to-BS (*base station*) radio spectrum**. 
They can be combined in one by *dividing the spectrum in frequency channels and divide each channel into time slots*.
![[Pasted image 20230301173537.png]]

Another methods is *CMDA - Code Division Multiple Access*: is a digital cellular technology that allows multiple users to share the same frequency band simultaneously. It works by **assigning a unique code to each user, which is used to modulate the user's signal.**

CDMA uses spread spectrum technology, which spreads the user's signal across a wide bandwidth. This makes it possible for multiple users to transmit their signals at the same time and on the same frequency band without interfering with each other.

The **unique code assigned to each user acts as a key to unlock the signal at the receiving end**. The receiver is able to identify and separate the different users' signals based on their unique codes, allowing each user to receive their own signal without interference from other users.
![[Pasted image 20230301173902.png]]
Even in case of different generated signal, if the receiver is able to known the code used by the sender, even if the received signal is the overlap of different codes of different sender the receiver will be able to reconstruct the data. The specific code used by the sender is negoatiated beforehand with the receiver. 

##### 2G Network Architecture (voice)

##### 3G Network Architecture (voice+data)
New cellular data network operate in parallel (*except at the edge*) with existing cellular voice network. The voice network is unchanged in core and operates *circuit switching* while *data network * 2G Network Architecture (voice)ates in parallel by operating **packet switching**.
