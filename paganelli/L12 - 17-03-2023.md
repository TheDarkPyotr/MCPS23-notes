# SDN - Software Defined Networking

The **network layer** have two main functions to be carried out:
- **Forwarding**: move packets from router's input to appropaite route output
- **Routing**: determine route takne by packet from source to destination
The forwarding activity is implemented by the ***data plane***, the routing is implemented by the ***control plane***. Respectively, both planes operates on fast timescale (*per-packet in case of forwarding*) and slow time scale (*per control event in case of routing*).

Two main approaches exists to structuring the network control plane:
- ***Per-router***: is the traditional one
- ***Logically centralized control***: also known as **Software Defined Networking**. 

### Per-router control plane
Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact with the control plane to compute the forwarding tables. 
In traditional IP networks, the control and data plae are ***tightly coupled***, embedded in the same networking devices and the whole structure is highly *decentralized*. The *network resilience* was a crucial design goal in the early days of Internet.

### Software-Defined Networking control plane
The ***remote controller*** computes and installs the forwarding tables in routers.

The rationale behind  a **logically centralized** control plane reside in the fact that is easier to carry out management network functions by *avoiding router misconfiguration* and gaining greater flexibility of traffic flowa. 
The so called *table-based forwarding* (*e..g OpenFlow API*) allows programming routers in different ways:
1. Centralized programming easier: compute tables centrally and distribute
2. Distributed programming more difficult: compute tables as a rsult of distributed algorithm implemented in each and every router

There are some difficult regarding the **traffic engineering** with a traditional router. For example, let's consider those scenarios and relatives implications

- *What if the network operator want `u-to-z` traffic to flow along `uvwz` rather than `uxyz`?* There is the need to re-define link weights so traffic routing algorithm computes routes accordingly: the tuning of the weight does not provide enough control on the routing itself.

- *what if network operator wants to split `u-to-z` traffic along `uvwz` and `uxyz` (load balancing)?* It's not possible or at lest require a new routing algorithm.

- *what if w wants to route blue and red traffic differently from w to z?* Not possible.
