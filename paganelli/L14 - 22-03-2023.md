## SDN Architecture

The main three components are:
1. **Data plane switches**: they implement genralized data-plane forwarding in hardware. The forwarding table is already computed, installed under the supervision of the controller. They provide also API for table-based switch control (*like OpenFlow*) and provide a protocol for communicating with controller. They are *dummy* devices, without added complex and routing mechanisms to be computed.
2. **SDN Controller**: mantain the network state infromation and interact with the network control application above via the *northbound* API and the network switches via the *southbound API*. It's implemeted as distributed system to guarantee scalability, performance and fault-tolerance. It separates the control and the data plane (*as opposed to classical routing*): it represent the Network Operating System because perform routing decision based on different criteria. 
3. **Network control apps**: they implement the control function (*like routing, access control and load balancing*) using lower-level services, API provided by the SDN Controller. This layer can also be *unbundled* so provided bi third-party supplier. Can have different routing vendor or SDN controller, customizable thanks to the northbound/southbound API exposure. Specifically, the northbound API provides an deeper abstraction respect to southbound API (*mainly OpenFlow*). 

## SDN Data Plane
The SDN data plane represent the resource or infrastructure layer made by forwarding devices: it allows to perform the transport and proessing of data according to decisions made by the SDN control plane. It perform those functions without embedding software, implementing an autonomous decision mechanism.
The data plane can have virtual switches or physical switches. 

The main function of the SDN data plane is to forward packets between network devices based on instructions provided by the SDN controller. The controller communicates with the data plane switches using a standardized protocol called OpenFlow, which allows the controller to program the switches to perform specific actions based on network conditions.

Some of the key functions of the SDN data plane include:

1.  **Packet forwarding**: The data plane switches are responsible for forwarding packets between network devices based on the instructions provided by the controller. They also need to be able to forward packets at high speeds, without causing bottlenecks or delays. It accepts incoming data flows from other network devices and end-systems: forwards them along the data forwarding paths computed and established according to the rules defined by the SDN applications.
	The *control support function* include the interaction with the SDN controller for management of forwarding rules (*the reference standard specification is mainly **OpenFlow Switch Protocol***).
1.  Traffic shaping: The data plane can implement traffic shaping policies to manage the flow of traffic through the network. For example, it can prioritize certain types of traffic, such as voice or video, over other types of traffic to ensure that they are delivered without delay.
    
3.  Security: The data plane can implement security policies to prevent unauthorized access to the network. For example, it can filter out packets that do not meet certain criteria, such as those coming from a known malicious source.
    
4.  Quality of Service (QoS): The data plane can implement QoS policies to ensure that certain types of traffic are given priority over others. For example, it can ensure that real-time applications like voice and video are given higher priority over other types of traffic.
    
5.  Load balancing: The data plane can implement load balancing policies to distribute traffic across multiple network paths. This helps to prevent congestion and ensure that traffic is delivered efficiently.

The **Generalized forwarding** operated by the data plane consists in providing each router a **forwarding table (*flow table*)** that use the *"match plus abstraction"*: match bits in arriving packets and take the corresponding action. Two main forwarding techniques are used:
1. **Destination-based forwarding**: forward based mostly on destination IP address
2. **Generalized forwarding (*followed by OpenFlow*)**: many header fields (*e.g. MAC Address, destination port, etc*) can determine the action and many actions are possible like `drop/copy/log packet/modify`. It generalize both matching information and action to be taken. 
The **flow** is defined by the header fields values (*respectively in link-,network-, transport-layer fields*): the generalized forwarding define simple packet handling rules:
- `match`: pattern values in packet header fields
- `actions`: for matched packet can `drop, forward, modify` or send matched packets to controller to decide the action to be performed. 
- `priority`: disambiguate overlapping patterns (*flows can match more than one entry so needs disambigution*)
- `counters`: allows to count the number of bytes and packets, mainly for statistics. Those are helpful to identify patterns and derive rules based on traffic volumes and parameters, updating the controller knowledge on the network. 

![[Pasted image 20230322114152.png]]The packet can be sent to the controller only once: the first time a packet is send back to the switches with informations for future patterns (*e.g. as in the last picture*).


### OpenFlow: Flow table entries
The following figure details the information that can be used at different layer to set the matching rules in the flow tables.

#### Examples
![[Pasted image 20230322164136.png]]
We can also implement the behavior of a switch:
![[Pasted image 20230322164414.png]]

#### OpenFlow abstraction
The *match plus action* abstraction allows to unifies different kinds of devices, based on their behavior:
- **Router**:
- **Switch**
- **Firewall**:
- **NAT***: the `match` is IP address and port, the `action` is to substitute a private IP address with a public IP address. 
So the boundaries between switches and behaviour is blurring.

##### Example 2
The idea is that the OpenFlow controller have a complete overview of the network, providing the forwarding tables to the switches without them implementing and re-compute the algorithms itself. 



### OpenFlow Switch
In a OpenFlow switch there is more than a one flow tables, usually organized in pipeline. The group table specify a more complex behavior that refer to a group of flows, specifing rules for group of flows based on their attribute. Both those two type of table specify the data plane. 
The control channel allows to communcate to the control plane: typically can have a connection with multiple controllers as they are implemented in a distributed way. The simplest configuration is the master-slave with only one controller while the complex one can include active-passive controller redundancy.

##### Flow table pipeline
The packet entering the switch are analyzed according to those mentioned tables: 
![[Pasted image 20230322171338.png]]
The passage through different table accumulate the actions associated with a given match, executing them only as final step before the packet is sent out:
![[Pasted image 20230322171528.png]]
If there is a match on one or more entry in the table, the match is defined to be witht the highest priorioty matching entry.
If there is a match only on a table-miss entry, the table entry may contain instructions as with any other entry. In practice, te tablemiss entry specifies one of three actions:
1. Send packet to controller: this will enable the controller to define anew flow for this  and similar packet or decide to drop the packet
2. Direct packet to another flow table further down the pipeline
3. Drop the packet
If there is no match on any entry and there is no table-miss entry, the packet is dropped. 


# SDN Control plane


![[Pasted image 20230324115208.png]]
We may distinguish three layers:
1. **Communciation layer**: in the bottom one there is the OpenFlow implementation and the SNMP protocol. 
2. **Network-wide state management**: the central part is the core of the controller. It collect and manage the infromation about the underluing infrastructure (*host information, how many switches, how many active ports are active*) and according to those information build the general network overview and extract statistics and manage dynamically flow tables.
3. **Interface latyer to network control apps**: In the upper layer there are components that handle the interaction with application like *network graph, RESTful API* to expose the network topology to the application or *intent* that, for example, state at high level *"drop the malicious traffic pattern"*  without specifying how: the SDN controller elaborates this intent and traduce this intent in a set of rules to be installated based on the current network topology. 


### OpenFlow protocol
It operates between controller and switches: use TCP to exchange messages (*suggested with TLS*). There are three classes of messages:
1.  **Controller to switch**: These OpenFlow messages are initiated by the controller and sent to the switch to manage its behavior. Examples of controller to switch messages include packet-out messages to send packets to a specific port or set of ports, flow-mod messages to add, modify or delete flow entries in the switch's flow table, and barrier-request messages to synchronize the switch's processing with the controller.
2.  **Asynchronous (Switch to controller)**: These OpenFlow messages are initiated by the switch and sent to the controller to notify it of events that occur on the switch. Examples of asynchronous messages include packet-in messages that inform the controller of packets that match a flow entry with the "send to controller" action, port-status messages that notify the controller of changes in the state of switch ports, and error messages that report errors encountered by the switch.
3.  **Symmetric (both directions)**: These OpenFlow messages can be initiated by either the controller or the switch and are sent in both directions to maintain the state of the OpenFlow channel. Examples of symmetric messages include echo-request and echo-reply messages to test the connectivity and responsiveness of the channel, and features-request and features-reply messages to exchange information about the switch's capabilities and configuration.

![[Pasted image 20230324115601.png]]
The main *controller-to-switch* messages can be of the following type:
- `features`: controller queries switch features, switch replies
- `configure`: controller queries/sets switch configuration parameters
- `modify-state` (*FlowMod*): the controll ask the switch to add, modify, delete an entry in the routing rule table
- `packet-out`: controller can send this packet out of specific switch port. The controller instruct the switch to implement a specific action for a specific pattern. 

The main *switch-to-controller* messages can be:
- `packet-in`: transfer packet to controller. For this packet the switch delegate the control to the controller. 
- `flow-removed`: the switch inform the controller that has deleted an entry in its flow table
- `port-status`:  inform the controller of a change on a port

Usually network oeprators don't *program* switches by creating/sending OpenFlow message directlu but use higher-level abstraction at controller. 

##### SDN: Control/data plane interaction example
![[Pasted image 20230324120358.png]]


1. S1 is experiencing link failure so uses OpenFlow **port status** message to notify the controller
2. SDN Controller receive the message and updates link status info
3. Dijkstra's roting algorithm application has previosuly registed to be called whenever link status change so it's called
4. Dijkstra's routing alg. access the network graph information, link state information in the controller and computes new routes
5. Link state routing app interacts with flow-table-computation component in the SDN controller, which omputes new flow tables needed
6. Controller uses Openflow to install new tables in swtiche sthat need updating
