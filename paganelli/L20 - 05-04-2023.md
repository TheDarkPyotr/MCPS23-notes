# Network Function Virtualization

Within SDN, allows *programmable networking*: it's mainly used in 5G and datacenter, allowing managing traffic with different requirements by performing load balancing, security, etc.
The global traffic trend have increased within the user requirements: more data and rapidly changing services involves also an increase in *CapEx*. 
To give a context, in traditional telco industry this increase was based on deploying physical equipment for each function that is part of a given service: this has led to *long product cycles, very low service agility and depencencies on specialized hardware (invest money and time to confgiure that must last years to not sustain useless costs).* 

A **typical enterprise network** is here pictured:

![[Pasted image 20230405162647.png]]
This network contains beside all the routing gear, the *load balancer* connected to the data center or the *DMZ* that provide computing for third services inside the enterprise network: those function manage flows for internal purpose (*IDS, VPN, Mail, etc*). Those last functions are good candidates to be virtualized by NFV. 
Virtualize this function represent an advantage because they're usually in high number inside an enterprise network (*taken from https://doi.org/10.1145/2070562.2070583 )*:

The complexity of internet arises, shifting from end to end device to a multiple type of device as an intermediary between two end nodes.
So we can state the problem as *increasing demand* from users and short-lived service with high data rates: this implies the need to purchase and operate physical equipment, obtaining a dense deployment of network equipment.
The telco operator so shifted from hardware pure based solution to software-based solution: they grouped in ETSI -  European Telco Standards Institute.

## Key idea
NFV address the previous problem by leveraging virtualization technologies: allows to **decouple hardware from sofware, allowing to migrate and execute network function where needed**. 
A **Network Service** can be decomposed into a set of **Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)**. 
![[Pasted image 20230405164413.png]]

The main **use cases** for NFV are the one where data plane packet processing and control plane in mobile and fixed network, like:
- **Switching elements**: BNG, CG-NAT, routers
- **Mobile network nodes**: HLR/HSS, MME, SGSN, GGSN/PDN-GW, RNC, Node B, eNodeB
- Functions contained in home routers and set top boxes to create virtualized home environments
-  **Tunneling gateway elements**: IPsec/SSL VPN gateways
- **Traffic analysis**: DPI, QoE measurement
- **Service Assurance, SLA monitoring, Test and Diagnostics**
- **NGN signaling**: IMS
- **Converged and network-wide functions**: AAA servers, policy control and charging platforms
-  **Application-level optimization**: CDNs, Cache Servers, Load Balancers, Application Accelerators
-  **Security functions**: Firewalls, virus scanners, intrusion detection systems, spam protection

##### Use case: vEPS
Both the **core (*EPC*)** and the **RAN** can be virtualized, this allows to improve the network usage efficiency and guarantee higher service resiliency thanks to the flexibility allocation of different NFs on the hardware pool and by providing dynamic network cnfiguration.
![[Pasted image 20230405165048.png]]

The following image shows how the shift from the hardware-based functions is performed by virtualize and splitting the function across different locations that can be connected by IP network, even if they're located in different datacenters, allowing a **virtualized RAN**.

![[Pasted image 20230405165139.png]]
The benefits are that in traditional networks, all devices are deployed on proprietary/closed platforms. All network elements are enclosed boxes, and hardware cannot be shared. Each device requires additional hardware for increased capacity, but this hardware is idle when the system is running below capacity.

With NFV, however, network elements are independent applications that are flexibly deployed on a unified platform comprising standard servers, storage devices, and switches. In this way, software and hardware are decoupled, and capacity for each application is increased or decreased by adding or reducing virtual resources

The cons consists in having **overhead** respect to the specialized hardware that can have **optimized performance** respect to a general device server.  

## Network service
Usually a telco operator need a chain of the Network function, being able to differentiate the treatment between each flow:

![[Pasted image 20230405165919.png]]
The pictured feature is called **Network service chaining**, also known as **service function chaining (SFC)** (*see [IEEE RFC7665](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/pdf/rfc7665.pdf)*) and is a capability that uses SDNs capabilities to create a chain of connected network services, such as L4-7 services like firewall, NAT and intrusion protection.

Network operators can use network service chaining to set up suites or catalogs of pathways for traffic travel through the network. Any one path can consist of any combination of connected services depending on the traffic’s requirements. Different traffic requirements might be more *security, lower latency, or an overall high quality of service (QoS)**.

The primary advantage of network service chaining is to automate the way virtual network connections can be set up to *handle traffic flow* for connected services. *For example, an SDN controller could take a chain of services and apply them to different traffic flows depending on the source, destination, or type of traffic. The chaining capability automates what traditional network administrators do when they connect up a series of physical L4-7 devices to process incoming and outcoming network traffic, which traditionally may require a number of manual steps.*

A *network service* in NFV is an **end-to-end network service** that can be defined as  ***forwarding graph of network functions and endpoints/terminals***, basically *what* an operator provides to customers.
A network service can be viewed architecturally as a *forwarding graph* of *Network Functions (NFs)* interconnected by supporting network infrastructure: these network functions can be implemented in a single operator network or interwork between different operator networks. The underlying network function behaviour contributes to the behaviour of the higher-level service.
![[Pasted image 20230405171050.png]]
In the previous picture there is a chain of network functions. The interconnections among the *NFs* and endpoints are depicted by *dashed lines*, representing logical links. These logical links are supported by physical paths through infrastructure networks (*wired or wireless*). Endpoints can be a network enterprise (`A`) or a datacenter (`B`), depending on the specific scenario. 

Here a topological view of the previous picture:
![[Pasted image 20230405171343.png]]
VNF can also be decomposed in different functions: the VNFs run as VMs on physical machine (*called **Points of Presence - PoPs***) so the placement it's generally located where it's function it's optimal. As an example, consider `VFN-1` as a cache service that is placed at the edge of the network. Consider also the pictured schema where the nested function *VNF-FG-2* is composed by three different *Virtualized Network Functions* (*respectively VNF-2A, VNF-2B, VNF-2C*). The virtualization allows to migrate and instantiate those functions among different PoPs, also automating those operations by **orchestrating** the setup, installation and execution of VFN autonomously.

#### NFV Architectural Framework
The **architectural framework** addresses the following:
- **NFVI (Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure)**: The resources required to setup a Network service
- **VNF (Virtualized Network Function)**: The functionality that is required due to the decoupling network functions into software and hardware
- **MANO (Management and Orchestration)** : allocate a set of virtual resources and support the management of orchestration of the functions

The general infrastructure is pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230405171948.png]]

The **NFV infrastructure (NFVI)** comprises the hardware and software resources that create the environment in which VNFs are deployed. Each **VNF** is implemented in software to run on virtual computing, storage, and networking resources. Finally, the ***NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO)***  is the component responsible for the management and orchestration of all resources in the NFV environment, ensuring the quality of service and the SLAs.

#### NFV Infrastructure
It comprehends the totality of all **hardware and software components** which build up the environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and executed by  virtualizing physical computing, storage, and networking and places them into resource pools.
The **physical hardware resources** include computing, storage and network that provide processing, storage and connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer (*e.g. hypervisor*). The computing hardware, in this context, is assumed to be general-purpose and the storage resources can be differentiated between shared network attached storage (*NAS*) and storage that resides on the server itself. 
![[Pasted image 20230409200655.png]]
Overall, inside the *NFV Infrastructure* we can identify 3 different domains:
- **Compute domain**: provides commercial off-theshelf (*COTS*) high-volume servers and storage. 
- **Hypervisor domain**: mediates the resources of the compute domain to the VMs of the software appliances, providing an abstraction of the hardware. (*e.g. VMs but now VNFs are also executed in containers, implementing Cloud Native Functions (CNF)*) 
- **Infrastructure network domain**: comprises all the generic high volume switches interconnected into a network that can be configured to supply network services.

The NFVI can span across *several location*. There are **two main types of networks**: 
- **NFVI-PoP network**: interconnects the computing and storage resources contained in an *NFVI-PoP*. It also includes specific switching and routing devices to allow external connectivity.
- **Transport network**: interconnects *NFVI-PoPs, NFVI-PoPs* to other networks owned by the same or different network operator, and *NFVI-PoPs* to other network appliances or terminals not contained within the *NFVI-PoPs*.
 
 We focus on **Infrastructure network domain** by providing an example of **OpenStack Networking deployment**:
 ![[Pasted image 20230405172420.png]]
In the previous picture, we have a dedicated *OpenStack Networking node* performing L3 routing and DHCP, and running advanced services like 
*FWaaS (Forwarding as a Service)* and *LBaaS (Load Balancing as a Service)*.
There are also two *Compute nodes* run the **Open vSwitch (*openvswitch-agent*)** and have two physical network cards each, one for tenant traffic, and another for management connectivity.
The OpenStack Networking node has a third network card specifically for provider traffic.
The **vSwitch** provide connectivity between VIFs (*Virtual Interfaces*) and PIFs (*Physical Interfaces*) that allows to connects different Virtual Machines. It also handle the traffic between VIFs colocated on the same physical host. The virtual switch usualy reside in the host and are tipically entirely software (*as an example, see [Open vSwitch](https://openvswitch.org)*).

### Management and Orchestration (MANO)
The following schema illustratesthe NFV Reference Architectural Framework: the *MANO* component is sketched on the right (*gray area*).

![[Pasted image 20230405173054.png]]
Overall, the *Management and Orchestration* component provides the functionality required for the **provisioning of the VNFs** by detailing the VNFs configuration and the configuration of the infrastructure on which the VNFs run. It also includes **orchestration and lifetime management of physical and/or software resources** supporting the infrastructure virtualization and the lifecycle management of VNFs.
Includes *databases* used to store information and data models defining deployment and lifecycle properties of functions, services and resources
Defines **interfaces used for communications between components of the MANO**, as well as coordination with traditional network management, such as *OSS/BS*.

Going bottom-up,  the first component is **VIM - Virtualized Infrastructure Management**: it comprises the functions that are used to control and manage the interaction of a VNF with computing, storage and network resources under its authority.
A single instance of a VIM is responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage, and network resources, usually within one operator’s infrastructure domain. To deal with the overall networking environment, multiple VIMs within a single MANO may be needed.

The second component is the **Virtual Network Function Manager - VNFM**: It oversees the *lifecycle management* by instation, update, query, scaling up/down, terminate of VNF instance. It's also under its responsibility the *collection of NFVI performance measurement results* and faults/events information, and correlation to VNF instance -related events/faults. 

Finally, the **NFV Orchestator - NFVO** is responsible for installing and configuring new network services (*NS*) and virtual network functions (*VNF*) packages alonside the management of the lifecycle of network service and global resources.
The **Network services orchestration** it's responsible of manage/coordinate the creation of an end-to-end service that involves VNFs: it creates end-to-end service between different VNFs  and can instantiate VNFMs, where applicable.
Differently, the **Resource orchestration** manages and coordinates the resources under the management of different VIMs.

Overall, the *NFV MANO* internal schema result in:
![[Pasted image 20230409203617.png]]
The **Network Services Catalog** act as a repositories of network services and have four main purposes:
1. **List of the usable network services**: a deployment template for a network service in terms of VNFs and description of their connectivity through virtual links is stored in NS catalog for future use.
2. **Database of all VNF descriptors (VNFD)**: a VNFD describes a VNF in terms of its deployment and operational behavior requirements.
3. List of **NFVI resources** utilized for the purpose of establishing NFV services.
4. List containing details about network services instances and related **VNF instances**.
