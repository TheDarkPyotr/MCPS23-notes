# Network Slicing
The 5G network are intended to provide three types of services:
- *mMTC - massive Machine Type Communications*: massive number of devices communicating with each other and requires low cost along with long battery backup time
- *URLLC - Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications*: needs simultaneos low-latency and increased reliability mechanisms 
- *eMBB - Enhanced Mobile Broadband*: higher data rates along with large coverage area 

Those services are not uniquely determined, but are correlated to the specific use case. The metrics can varies as the specific technical requirements. In the following table are reported the guarenteed services with a relative example and the ensured requirements:

**Network slicing** idea is to create different logical network on top of the physical one. The resources are pooled together, on the physical resources: this allows to shape and address the requirements of the previous use cases.
Each subnetwork will perform slicing of the physical network resources to yield an *independent network* for its applications. 

Basically network slices allows to create *customzed networks* realized by creating multiple virtual and end-to-end networks. 
This can be done by exploiting the two technical element already presented:
- NFV: implemenets the NFs in a *network slice*. The virtualization alllows the isolation of each network slice from all other slices: this assures QoS and security requirements for that slice, independently from other network slices.
- SDN: once a network slice is defined, SDN operates to minitor and enforce Qos requirements by controlling and enforcing the behavior of the traffic flow for each slice.

There are several ways to combine NFV with SDN: the SDN controller can be used with the *VIM (Virtual Infrastructure Manager)* to program and route the traffic flows, providing traffic isolations and balancing the resources to some flows respect to other. 

### 5G Use case
The general scenario is sketched here, without great detail:

Two locations: the edge it's closer to antennas and the core cloud is the remote one. The underlying hypothesis is that the first have few resources compared with the core cloud DC: if you need to support low-latency requirements, balancing resources respect to the total utilization and flow heavy computation to the core cloud. 

Some terminology:
	- v2x: for application services
	- *Radio Unit (RU)*: radio hw unit 
	- *Distributed Unit (DU)*: typically deployed close to the RU
	- *Centralized Unit (CU):* can be placed in the cloud (*radio resource control, packet data converge protocol*)
NFV allows to move those functions where needed, based on specific requirements and provied resources.
For the phone slice, the core is distributed in the core cloud, moving the workload to the more resource-powered location.
The distinguish scenario between IoT consists in having the possibility, in the second case, to move the function from the core to the edge.

The isolation of different flow is usually prformed by the vSwitch or vRouter within a node. The SDN SW (*ingress*) classify the traffic incoming from the fronthaul: flow filtering enforces isolation and implement the forwarding rules based on the classification provided.  The traffic flows through the *egress* router and flows in the specific VPN.
SDN Controllers allows to define how to handle the traffic, defining the flow rules.
