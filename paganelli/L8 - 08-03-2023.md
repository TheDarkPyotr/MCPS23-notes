Continuining from [[L5 - 01-03-2023]]
## 3G vs. 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) network architecture
![[Pasted image 20230308162341.png]]

The changes are in the core network, like:
- **All-IP core**: IP packets are tunneled from base station to gateway and there is no separation between voice and data so all traffic is carried over IP core to gateway.

## 4G/5G cellular networks
There are some similarities to *wired internet* like:
- edge/core distinction where we have application services (edge) and core (e.g. services to authenticate devices)
- Global cellular network: operators agree on a network of networks among all geographical countries
- Use of protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, DHCP
- Mobile networks are interconnected to internet to be able to use services

Between differences from wired internet there are:
- Mobility as a first class service
- User *identity* via SIM card
- Business models: user subscribe to a cellular provider called "home network" that works differently when roaming on visited nets. The global access is granted thanks to authentication infrastructure and inter-carrier settlements

#### Architecture
![[Pasted image 20230309160212.png]]
- **Mobile Core**: provides IP (*internet*) connectivity for both data and voice servics. Also ensure QoS requirements and allows to tracks user mobility to ensure uninterrupted service, providing *billing* and *charging*. 
- **Blackhaul Network**: allows to connect base station to mobile core (*interconnecting the RAN*) by using optics or wireless solution (*IAB - Integrated Access Blackhaul*).
- **Radio Access Network (RAN)**: it's a distributed connection of Base Stations (BSs) and allows to manage the radio spectrum. 

### Elements of 4G architecture
![[Pasted image 20230309160614.png]]

In the **radio access network** the mobile device can be a large series of devices like *laptop, ioT* devices with 4G LTE radio: they are identified by 64 bit *International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)* stored on the **SIM - Subscriber Identity Module**. 

The **core network** is composed by ***Home Subscriber Service - HSS*** that contains information about subscribers with their identifiers and allows to manage the authentication phase. It mantains the information about the device's "*home network*".To be able to authenticate, it works with ***Mobile Management Entity - MME***. 

The **Mobile Management Entity** perform the device authentication, coordinated with mobile home network HSS. The *MME* is also involved when changing the base station and allows to track the device and page the device location (*ask the base station for the presence of this device*). 
For data packets transfer we need to establish a *data path* from the mobile device to the ***Serving Gateway (S-GW)*** (the *tunneling* and the data path is explained later).
Both the *Serving Gateway (S-GW) and PDN Gateway (P-GW)* are on the path from mobile to/from internet network: the S-GW forwards IP packets to and from the RAN, the P-GW is a gatway to mobile cellular network that looks like any other internet gateway router. It provides *NAT services* and support access-related functions like *policy enforcement, traffic shaping and charging*. 
When devices move to one base station to another,also the S-GW gateway is involved in this process. 

A simplified view of the *mobile core* architecture: 

![[Pasted image 20230308164331.png | 600]]
For example, a single **MME/PGW** pair might serve a metropolitan area, with SGWs deployed across ~10 edge sites spread throughout the city, each of which serves ~100 base stations.

In 4G there is a strong separation between **data plane** and **control plane** that allows the mobility management and the boostrapping of the data path:

![[Pasted image 20230308164601.png]]

The **base station** forwards both control and user plane packets between the mobile core and the user. The separations concerns:
- ***Control plane***: the packts are tunneled over SCTP/IP (Stream Control Transport Protocol) that is an altenative reliable transport to TCP, tailored to *carry signaling (control)*. It allows to provide user's device authentication, registration and mobility tracking.
- ***User plane***: packets are tunneled over **GTP (General Packet Radio Service) Tunneling Protocol. 
![[Pasted image 20230309162952.png]]


The Long Term Evolution (LTE) **data plane protocol stack** in the *core network* adopt, as already mentioned, the **tunneling mechanism**: mobile datagrams are encapsulated using GPT and sent inside a UDP packet to the Serving Gateway (S-GW). The S-GW re-tunnels the UDP datagrams to P-GW, allowing reaching internet networks. 
The tunneling mechanism described allow supporting *mobility*: only tunneling endpoints change when mobile user moves. 
In this context the S-GW represent a it's a fixed point both from the device to internet and viceversa so if the device change base station, the S-GW is able to *retrieve* the new base station of the device and change the IP address to deliver the packet to the correct base station in which the device is connected. This mechanism allows to implement mobility across base stations.

#### LTE: Link Layer Protocol
The **first hop LTE Link Layer protocols** in the IP range defines:
- **Packet Data Convergence**: contains header for compression, decompression, encryption and decryption. 
- **Radio Link Control (RLC)**: implement fragmentation/re assembly by ensuring reliable data trasnfer. 
- **Medium Access**: requesting and use of radio *transmission slots*
![[Pasted image 20230308165650.png]]

Between the *LTE radio access network* we have several mechanism like:
- **Downstream channel**: combination of FDM and TDM within frequency channel (*OFDM - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing: orthogonal refer to minimal interference between channels.*)
- **Upstream**: FDM, TDM similar to OFDM. 
Each **active mobile device allocated two or more 0.5 ms timeslots in or more channel frequencies**. The scheduling algorithms is not standardized so it's up to the operator and allows up to 100's Mbps per device. 


### Associating with a base station
![[Pasted image 20230309164925.png]]
1. BS broadcast primary synchronization signal every 5 ms on all frequency
2. Mobile finds a primary synch signal and locate the second synch signal on this frequency: mobile then finds info broadcast by BS like channel bandwidth and configuration. Mobile may get informations from multiple base stations, multiple cellular networks.
3. Mobile selects which BS to associated with (*e.g. prefererence for home carrier*)
4. More steps till needed to authenticated, establish state and set up control plane. 

The **sleep modes** of LTE allows to put radio to *sleep* to conserve battery:
1. *Light Sleep*: afet 100 millisecond of inactivity: need to wake up periodically to check downstrema transmissions. 
2. *Deep Sleep*: after 5-10 seconds of inactivity then the mobile may change cells while deep sleeping so need to re-establish association


## 5G architecture
The main goal of 5G is to icnrease in peak bitrate, 10x decrease in latency and 100x increase in traffic capacity over 4G. 
THe **5G New Radio Frequencies** have two fruquency bands:
- *FR1*: 450MHz - 6 GHz
- FR2: 24GHz - 52 GHz
The 5G is not backwards-compatible with 4G: the *millimiter wave frequencies* have much higher data rates but over shorter distances because uses **pico-cells** that have a diameter of 10 to 100m. This implies a dense deployment of *new base station*.

The underlying idea is to realize the functions of authentication, tracing and so on by means of **microservices** implemented throught ***Network Function Virtualization***: this allows the deploy of those function is both close to the core network and base stations so the path between the mobile device and the function/service is really close, reducing the latency and load balancing the traffic. This also avoid traffic directly flow into the core network and manage the traffic at the edge. 

### 5G User Plane
![[Pasted image 20230309171843.png]]

The **UPF - User Plane Function** allows to forward traffic between RAN and internet, corresponding to the S-GW/P-GW combination into the **EPC**. It's also responsible for:
- Packet inspection and application detection
- QoS management
- Traffic usage reporting
This component allows flexibility to deliver user plane functionality at the edge as well as the network core because UPF can be co-located with edge and central data centers at both locations, implementing laso **MEC - Multi Access Edge Computing*** (see next lecture). 

### 5G Control Plane

![[Pasted image 20230309172235.png | 700]]
- ***AMF (Core Access and Mobility Management Function)***: connection and reachability management, mobility management, access authentication and authorization, and location services ->MME 
- ***SMF (Session Management Function)***: manages each UE session, including IP address allocation, selection of associated UP function, control aspects of QoS, and control aspects of UP routing. -> MME and the control-related aspects of PGW. 
- ***PCF (Policy Control Function)***: manages the policy rules that other CP functions then enforce. -> PCRF. 
- ***UDM (Unified Data Management)***: Manages user identity, including the generation of authentication credentials. -> HSS. 
- ***AUSF (Authentication Server Function)***: Essentially an authentication server. -> HSS.
- ***SDSF (Structured Data Storage Network Function)***: a “helper” service used to store structured data. 
- ***UDSF (Unstructured Data Storage Network Function)***: A “helper” service used to store unstructured data. 
- ***NEF (Network Exposure Function)***: A means to expose select capabilities to third-party services
- ***NRF (NF Repository Function)***: A means to discover available services. 
- ***NSSF (Network Slicing Selector Function)***: A means to select a Network Slice to serve a given UE. Network slices are essentially a way to partition network resources in order to differentiate service given to different users


### Deployment options

## Mobility

From the network perspective, the spectrum of mobility is:
![[Pasted image 20230308173344.png]]

The **home networks** allows to have a service plan with a cellular provider (*Verizon, Orange*) where the home network HSS stores identity and service informations of the device. The **visited network** is any network other than your home network and by service agreement with other networks allows to provide access to *visiting mobile*, implementing mobility. 

![[Pasted image 20230309174849.png]]

**Wifi/ISP** **does not have a concept of Home network where the user informations are stored** **but** they are stored on the device or with the user (eg. username, password), different networks different credentials (*Think of eduroam*).

To implement mobility and have a correspondence between the mobile device and the home network/visited network we have two different approaches:
1. **Network router handle it**: the network router handle the management of the mobility. The routers advertise well-known name, addresses (*e.g. permanent 32-bit IP address*) or number (*phone cell*) of visting mobile node via usual *routing table exchange*. 
	Internet rotung could do this already without changes: routing tables indicate where each mobile is located by using **Longest Prefix Match**. 
	This approach is not scalable to a billions of mobiles: we could have routing tables too large to expand and retrieve data (*coconsidering 32 bit IP addresses*). 
2. **End-system handle it**: the funcionality is provided at the *edge*. There are two types of routing:
	1. ***Indirect routing***: communication from correspondent to mobile goes through home network and then forwrded to remote mobile (*connected to a thid-party visited network*). The correspondant, known the home network gateway send the request and thanks to the HSS - Home Subscriber Server that contains the updated address of the device, is able to forward the request to the Serving Gateway of the *visited network*. 
			![[Pasted image 20230309180332.png | 700]]
	1. ***Direct routing***: correspondents get foreign address of mobile, sending directly to mobile device. The *IMSI* is used as a sort of *MAC address* of the device 
	![[Pasted image 20230309180602.png | 800]]

In the ***indirect routing*** a mobile-device-to-visited network association protocol is needed: the mobile device will need to assicate with the visited network and will similarly need to disassociate when leaving the visited network. There is also the need of a *visited-network-to-home-network-HSS registration* to allows visited network to register mobile device's location with the HSS In the home network.
A datagram tunneling protocol between the home network gateway and the visited network gateway router is needed to allows home gateway performs encapsulation and forwarding of the correspondents original datagram and, on the receiving side, the gateway router performs decapsulation, NAT translation and forwarding of the original datagram to the mobile device. 

In the ***direct routing*** the process is less transparent o the correspondent because it must get care of the address from home agent. In case the mobile changes visited network the request sending can be handled but with additional complexity by allowing the HSS to be queried by the correspondent only at the beginning of the session.
