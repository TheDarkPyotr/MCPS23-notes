The Fourier series is defined also for signals with **arbitrary period**. Given a continuous signal $s(t): \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, periodic in the interval $[-\frac{T}{2}, \frac{T}{2}]$.
Use the substitution $y = \frac{2\pi t}{T}$ obtaining:
$f(y) = s(\frac{2\pi t}{T})$
which is periodi in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$:
$f(y) = s(\frac{2\pi t}{T}) = \frac{1}{2}a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_{n}cos(ny)+b_{n}sin(ny)$
Returning to the initial variable $y = \frac{2\pi t}{T}$ we obtain:
$s(t) = \frac{1}{2}a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_{n}cos(\frac{2\pi n}{T}t)+b_{n}sin(\frac{2\pi n}{T}t)$
obtaining the coefficiencies already seen, computed in the interval $[-\frac{T}{2}, \frac{T}{2}]$:

- $a_{0} = \frac{2}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} s(t)dt$
- $a_{n}= \frac{2}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} s(t)cos(nt)dt$
- $b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} s(t)sin(nt)dt$

#### Continuous signal energy
Given a signal $s(t)$ defined in the interval $[-\frac{T}{2}, \frac{T}{2}]$, the *energy* of the signal is defined as:

$E_{s}(t) \doteq \int_{\frac{-}}$

#### Power of signal

#review page 40


The power of a signal is computed by an average of the energy of a signal (divided by T). 

#review 41
Periodic signals are an important class of signals with finite power

Between energy signals we have limited duration signals like istantaneous signals.

## Fourier Transform
We introduce complex number to introduce a different expression of the Fourier series. This notaton allows to express the Series compactly and explain the Discrete Fourier Transform with the same mathematical tools.

we can have different coefficient by varying n values, obtaining different harmonics.
N.b. the sum goes to -inf to +inft
This formulation allows to compact the notation, obtaining aa single coefficient and overall, $s(t)$ express concisely [#review].

$\theta_{n}$ represent the phase  of the harmonic

*Basic idea*: We consider a periodic signal but with an increasing period T to infinity thus the fundamental frequency is decreasing so the signal became less and less periodic, obtaining an aperioid or non-perdioic signal because the frequency are close to eacher other, obtaining a continuous set of frequencies.

#review Continuous in time and continunous in frequency

CTF can be kwnon as Continuous FT or only Fourier Transform from different notation,

The contribution of the lower frequencies became more important as the signal became more flat. 

cutting the higher frequencies make the inverse of TC with cutted angles (*low pass filter example*)

Discrete time signals are relevant, e.g. human speech, we want to take some sample of this continuois sounds: we start with T real and consider its multiple nT. Here consider discrete istant of time.
DTS is defined only for signal for which we known a limited set of samples: the DTS is computed by summing up the discrete value and the exponential. It also compute for a finite number of frequencies, associated with the finite set of values.

The moltiplication between the two is a finite number. 
The anti-trasform allows to obtain the original samples.


Compute the DTF only for multiple of fundsmnral frequency 1/T.
