# Analog to digital conversion
The sampling activity allows to transform a continous signal in a time-discrete value, allowing to convert it in a digital value, allowing to perform computation without modify the signal structure and without using special hardware purpose: the original signal is converted in a **sequence of integers** that can be stored and computed by an electronic device.
The *conversion* activity is performed by the *ADC - Analog to Digital Converter* and includes two main operations:
- **Sampling**: the sampling allows to obtain a sequence $s(t)$ and from it extract the integer sequence at **predefined intervals** (*uniform in space*). The interval between two sequential samples is called **sampling period**. 
- **Quantization**: transform the stream of *real numbers* produced by the sampling into a *stream of numbers* tht can be of *integer* or *float* type. The different type depends on the specific task to perform on the signal. 
The *sampling activity* allows to represent the original signal under some hypothesis (*detailed later in Sampling theorem*), while the *quantization* express how much information is **lost**.

The entire process, considering a signal $s(t)$ is sketched here:
![[Pasted image 20230526111003.png]]

Given $s(t)$, first we convert from analogic to digital and then we obtain a sampled signal readed at multiple values of $T_{c}$. Receiver side the signal is converted from digital to analogic, obtaining a signal more similar to the real one, before sampling activity.

The sampling activity for **continuous signals** can be described as:  a *discrete signal* $g(nT), n \in \mathbb{Z}$, can be obtained with a *uniform sampling of continuous signal $s(t)$* where 
$g(nT) = s(nT)$
with $T$ is the sampling period, and $\frac{1}{T}$ is the sampling frequency.

### Example
Imagine to have the signal $s(t)=\sin(t)$ with frequency $f = \frac{1}{2\pi} = 0.159$ and assume to sample the signal with period $T_{c} = 3.09$, thus the *sampling frequency* is grether than the frequency of the original signal ($T_{c} = 3.09 \rightarrow f_{c} = 0.234 > 2f$) .
![[Pasted image 20230526111958.png]]
The sampling is a signal itself, $s(nT_{c})$, which takes a value for every multiple of the sampling period $T_{c}$. 
The original signal is a *power signal* while the signal we obtain with the sampling it's composed by values taken at distnace $T_{c}$ thus it's now a *power signal*. 
The sampling frequency is little more than $2f$ (*two times the signal*).

To reconstruct a continuous signal from a given set of samples, several methods can be applied, like **interpolation**. There are several way to reconstruct the signal, based on it's type:
- *Piecewise-costant signal*: methods like *zero-order hold* or *nearest neighbor*
- *Piecewise linear*: like *first-order hold reconstruction*
![[Pasted image 20230526112203.png]]
To apply the *zero-hold method*, consider a discrete-time signal with known samples at equally spaced intervals. Let's say we have a signal $x[n]$,  where $n$ represents the sample index. The zero-hold interpolation estimates the value of the signal $x(t)$ at any continuous-time point $t$.

## Sampling theorem
The sampling theorem give the **minimum sampling frequency** to be able to have enough information to reconstruct the signal from the given set of samples. It defines ideal conditions that not always can be applied to real world signals.

Here we compare two different sampling frequency for signal $x(t)=\sin(\frac{2\pi}{T}t)$. For the first case, the sampling frequency is higher than the signal frequency ($f_{c} >> \frac{1}{T}$) while for the second one is minor.
![[Pasted image 20230526142720.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230526142733.png]]
For the minor case, the original signal is the blue one but the sampled signal, due to minor frequency, is the red one: this does not allows to reconstruct correctly the real signal. This problem is also known as **aliasing** (*see later*).

##### Theorem definition
Consider a signal $s(t)$ with *spectrum null* at frequencies above $f_{M}$ (*the **maximum frequency of the signal**)*, thus the band of frequencies of $s(t)$ is limited. 
The signal $s(t)$ is **completely represented** by its samples taken:
- at regular intervals $t_{n} = nT_{c}, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
- with a sampling period $T_{c} \leq \frac{1}{2f_{m}}$
thus from the samples it's possible to reconstruct $s(t)$ for any $t$ by:
		$f_{C_{min}} = \frac{1}{T_{C_{max}}} = 2f_{m}$

This $f_{c_{min}}$ is called **Nyquist frequency**: it's the minimum frequency for which it's possible to sample the signal $s(t)$ limited in band. This implies that we can sample the signal only at higher frequency. Under this conditions we can reconstruct the signal using interpolation, for example (*based on cardinal sin*):
$s(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} s(nT_{c}) \times \frac{\sin(\pi f_{c} \times (t-nT_{c}))}{\pi f_{c} (t-nT_{c})}$

The **Fourier Transform** of a band limited signal sampled $X(f)$ as described by the Sampling Theorem consists of shifted and scaled copies of $X(f)$:
![[Pasted image 20230526114412.png]]

The spacing between the replicas of $X(f)$ depends on the *sampling rate*: the faster we sample, the further apart the replicas of $X(f)$. Sampling every $T$ seconds implies that the spacing between the replicas in the **frequency domain** is equal to the sampling frequency $f_{s} = 1/T$. 


#### Drawbacks
The hypothesis under which Nyquist frequency is valid are not always applicable to real world signals: there is no signal that is limited in band because a signal of this type would not have energy under a certain band of frequency and thus it must extend to infinity.
For **periodic signals** the transform is performed by assuming a period $T \rightarrow \infty$.
The hypothesis involves a number of infinite samples but in limited time we must limit the number of sample to a finite number, increasing the sampling frequency to better approximate the signal. 

## Aliasing
The *aliasing problem* arises when the *Sampling theorem* result it's not applied, thus we sample at a lower frequency. 
Suppose have a signal $s(t)$: the set of samples itself does not contains all the information to reconstruct the original signal, leading to an *incorrect frequency estimation*. 
We could have takne the following set of samples:

![[Pasted image 20230526115252.png]]
From this set we can reconstruct different signals, all different from the original one, with different frequencies, like the green one picture here:
![[Pasted image 20230526115356.png]]

Starting from the given set of sample we could reconstruct an **infinite number of armonics**, undistinguishable from the armoncis of the original signal, like the following one:
![[Pasted image 20230526115550.png]]

In general, the *spectrum* of the **sampled signal** $S_{c}(t)$ consists of **infinite replicas** of the spectrum of $s(t)$, **centered at frequencies multiple of $f_{c}=3$:
![[Pasted image 20230526120142.png]]
This is the rationale behind the Nyquist condition to have $s(t)$ limited band: if we limit the signal in the image at frequency $f_{M} = 1.5$ we can disregard all the replicas (*which have higher frequency*). 
![[Pasted image 20230526120124.png]]

Hence, if $s(t)$ is **strictly limited in band** with null spectrum at frequencies above $f_{M}$, we can choose $f_{c}$ to esnure that the replicas of the spectrum of $s(t)$ **do not overlap**.

### Nyquist implication
No real-world signal is *perfectly limited in bandwidth*: such a signal shoud not have energy beyond a frequency band but for this must extended *infinitely in time*.

However, even if the signal is bounded in frequency there is no mean to sample a signal from the real-world and to rebuild the signal perfectly, unless we take an **infinite number of samples**: the bound of Nyquist is on the frequency of sampling, not on the number of samples required. 

In practice, many signals are almost limited in a band, meaning that *their spectrum beyond their band is small* (*i.e. their energy beyond the band is small*). 
In any sampling you can expect a **little distorsion** due to this fact,  but with a "*good*"" sampling this distortion is negligible.
Furthermore, it is also possible to use a ***cutoff filter*** that cuts out frequencies above a threshold from a signal in order so to meet the Nyquist requirements

Nyquist real-world application sometimes are based on wrong assumption or interpretation of the Nyquist Shannon theorem, as largely discussed in [Sampling: What Nyquist Didn’t Say, and What to Do About It -  Tim Wescott](https://neuron.eng.wayne.edu/auth/ece4330/practical_sampling.pdf).
Here we summarize some mistakenly use cited by *Tim Wescott*'s work.

##### Mistake 1
"*I am going to sample at 8kHz, so I need to use a filter with a 4kHz cutoff*"
Nyquist did not say that if you are sampling at rate $N$ samples per second you can use an *anti-aliasing* filter with a *cutoff frequency* $f=N/2$.
No analog filter is perfect, and there is a significant amount of frequencies above $4KHz$ that pass, despite can be attenuated.
The result is that the aliased signal is not negligible and seriously disturbs your sampling.
A possible solution is to **oversample**: samples are taken per unit of time than what is strictly necessary to satisfy the Nyquist criterion.
An example is given by the old, analog telephone *powerline* that used a stronger *cutoff* of $3KHz$ and they oversampled at $8 KHz$. 

##### Mistake 2
- *"I need to monitor the 60Hz power line, so I need to sample at 120Hz"*
- *"We have a signal at 1kHz we need to detect, so I need to sample at 2kHz*"

Nyquist did not say that a signal that repeats $N$ times a second has a bandwidht of $N$ hertz.
In fact, the powerline is nominally at $60Hz$ but in fact you can see a lot of distortion, meaning that there are many other frequencies involved.

If you dont' use *anti-aliasing filters*, you need to figure out the **maximum frequency of the signal**: if it come out that, as in this case, up to the *fifth harmoniI need to monitor the 60Hz power line, so I need to sample at 120Hz»
«We have a signal at 1kHz we need to detect, so I need to sample at
2kHz»c ($300Hz$)* is meaningful, you should sample at least **twice that frequency** ($600Hz$).

So the quest should be rephrased: "*I need to monitor the 60Hz power line, so I guess need to sample at **well over 120Hz***".
This is still *not entirely true*: in some cases we could even **downsample**. In this specific case, because the signal **repeat continuously, it's steady and with a known and steady frequency**,so downsampling allows still to reconstruct the signal well enough. 
Here an example:
![[Pasted image 20230526140651.png]]
A hint is that the **signal phase** within a **cycle** will advance a little bit with each new sample. If we ***sample long enough***, we can have enough information to reconstruct the original signal, but we need to know that it is a **steady, repetitive signal with a steady frequency.**

## Quantization
As mentioned, the after the sampling activity the obtained number are usually real $\mathbb{R}$, because is some cases the floating point representation it's costly.
The **quantization** indicates an *approximation of the sampled value* so that the value can be represented in the interval $[0,2^{R}-1]$. 

Consider a signal $s(t)$ with a **sample frequency** $f_{c}$: the value $x_{k}$ is the readed sample in the time interval $I_{k}$. 
The quantization activity allows to encode $x_{k}$ in a **integer value** $y_{k} \in [0, 2^{R}-1]$, with $R$ the **number of bit per sample**. This definition allows to define the **bit rate** for a signal sampled at frequency $f_{c}$ as:
			$R_{b} = R \times f_{c}$ bit/sec
The error can be quantified  as **quantized error**:$s(t)-y_{k}$ where $y_{k}$ is the quantized value.

The *quantization noise* can be of two different type:
- **Overload**: each adjacent point in the set value is not capable of represent a value of $s(t)$ outiside the representation range, so $s(t) > 2^{R}-1$.  The value of the signal at time $t$ exceeds the representation used by the quantization, leading to the scenario in figure. This can be solved by using some *flag bits* to represent higher or lower points
- **Granular noise**: occurs beause all values in interval $I_{k}$ are represented with a unique $y_{k}$. The representation of the sampled value is not able to properly represent the minimal variations of the signal is a smaller value range.

![[Pasted image 20230526142358.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230526142412.png]]
*Caption*: blu area variations are represented with the same $y_{k}$ value.

#### Example
The human ear can hear between 20 and 20k Hz. With an acceptable degradation in quality, it can be cut at around $4KHz$, hence the *sampling rate* $f_{c} = 8KHz$, each sample quantized on $R=8$ bits and thus the bit rate $R_{b} = 64Kbps$.
