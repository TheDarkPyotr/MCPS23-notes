## Wireless networks

Wireless allows to replace cables in communications in cyber-physical systems that can embed computers in physical objects.
Wireless networks are networks of **hosts** connected by **wireless  links**: we refer to host as end-system devices that run applicaiton (battery-powered, small or mobile).
There are two modes of operations:
- **Infrastrucuture**: e.g. by providing an Access Point that can provide a link to a cabled infrastracture and offer various services
- **Ad hoc networking**: there is no centra coordinations so they must somehow coordinate themself and manage properly shared resources

The network infrastructure can be a mix of cabled and wireless infrastructure. The devices connected to the base station can be both mobile or not; the same can happen with the type of links that can be cabled or wireless, depending on the scenario. 
The **base station** have a revelent role in structured network: it's responsible to manage the resources of the *physical medium*. They usually are represented by cell towers or Access Point. 
The **wireless  links** allows to connect mobile to base station and can be used as backbone links. In **infrastructure mode** base station connectmobiles into wired networks. Mobile can changes base station providing connection into wired network. 

#### Charateristic of wireless links

The category `802.11` refers to the Wifi family of protocols.

## Wireless Network taxonomy
We distingish the network type based on two category:
![[Pasted image 20230224163936.png]]
An example of *infrastructure, single hop* is the mobile connection or throught the WiFi. 
The schema behing *no infrastructure, multiple hosts* is used when different devices needs to exchange information and makes routing decisions among them, without relying on a fixed infrastructure. 

## Charateristics of wireless communications
There are foundamental differences between wired and wireless links:
- **Decreased signal length**: radio signals attenuates as it propagates trhought matter causing **path loss**
- **Interference**: wireless frequency can be shared by other wireless devices by specification but engines or appliances may interfere as well.
- **Multipath propagation**: the reflection of the wave on context object can be distorted and change the origianl signal that it's necessary to rebuild

### Communication Environment metrics
Some important metrics in **communication environment** are:
- **SNR - Signal to Noise Ratio**: measured at the received. The SNR *bit error rate* (**BER**) is the probability that a transmitted bit is received in error at the receiver. Based on different modulation technique we can achieve a lower or higher data rates, with different BER.
- ![[Pasted image 20230225093643.png]]
- *BPSK* have a lower data rate and if we increase the SNR by increasing the *energy of the signal*, we lower the BER.
- For QAM16: you need more energy to get the same BER than BPSK at a certain level, as you send more information.

### Obstacles
Signal attenuation or obstacles limit transmission ranges: the situation sensed by a node, given that there may be a wall, which prevents two devices to detect each other, while they can talk with a central host.
According to how those host are positioned in distance:
* `A` has large signal strenght to `B`, but when we arrive at `B` the energy of the signal decrease and `B` is able to detect it.
* With higher distance `A` is not able to detect `C` signal.
Also since `B` may receive two different signals at the same time, it may be difficult for it to reconstruct a signal.
![[Pasted image 20230224165435.png]]
With the distance the amplitude of the signal decrease but despite that, the signal from C to B is received, the same from A to C but the intersection of receiving two signals from two different sources to B can be problematic. 

Some of wireless network challenges are that nodes have  **limited knowledge** regarding a terminal that cannot hear all the others or **hidden/exposed terminal** problems (*see later*). Another main problem is **Mobility or Failure of terminals** in which they move in the range of different base station. **Limited terminals** regards the battery life, memory and processing.

## Wireless network protocol stack
![[Pasted image 20230224170808.png]]

Let's describe the **MAC layer** for wired network. We start from simple assumption like: 
1. a *single channel for all communications
2. all stations can transmit on it and receive, 
3. if frames are sent simultaneously on the channel the resulting signal is *garbled* and a **collision** is generated, generally all stations can detect collisions. 
Different protocol are at this level, like: *ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, CSMA, etc*.

### CMSA/CD - Carrier Sense Multiple Accesses with Collision Detection
The basic idea is that when a station has a frame to send, it first listens to the channel to see if anyone else is transmitting: if the channel is **busy**, the station waits until it becomes **idle**. When a channel is *idle*, the station transmits the frame: if a *collision* occurs the station waits a random amount of time and repreat procedures.
![[Pasted image 20230224171228.png]]
In the pictured scenario, the signal is transmitted at time $t_{0}$ because the channel was *idle* but at time $t_{1}$ another signal (*the red one*) is transmitted by generating a collision on the channel. 
So in CSMA/CD a station **abort its transmission as soon it detects a collision**: if two stations sense the channel idle simultaneously and start transmitting, they quickly abort the frame as soon collision is detected. It's widely used on LAN In MAC sub-layer like *IEEE 802.3 Ethernet*.

The CSMA/CD behaviour can be descriped by defining:
- `T` is the *time required to reach the fartest station*
- It takes a minimum of RTT time (`2*T`) to detect a collision
![[Pasted image 20230225094641.png]]
 So we can consider a **slotted system** with *mini-slots* of duration $2\tau$, so if a node starts transmission at the beginning of a mini-slot, by the end on the slot either two things can happen:
 1. No collision occurred and the rest of the transmission will be uninterrupted (because now the channel is occupied and this condition is detectable by other nodes)
 2. A collision occured but by the end of the mini-slot the channel would be idle again
![[Pasted image 20230225094934.png]]
 So a collision at most affect *one* mini-slot. 


#### Binary Exponential Backoff
The algorithm used by CMSA/CD to retry retransmission is called **Binary Exponential Backoff** and defines how much time the station must wait before trying transmitting again. 

The time after a collision is divided in **contention slots**: the lenght of a slot is equal to the *worst case round propagation time* (*so if $T$ is the time to reach the most distant station, the length will be $2T$*). 
After the first collision each station waits 0 or 1 slot before trying again: so after collision $i$ the nodes chooses $x$ at random in the interval $[0, 2^{i}-1]$ so that it skips $x$ slots of time before retrying the trasmission. 
Number at hands, after:
- 10 collisions, interval is frozen at $[0, 1023]$
- 16 collisions, failure is reported to upper levels (*retrasmission is aborted*). 

#### Why does this approach not work with wireless network?
The algorithm described is suitable in **wired networks** but not in **wireless scenarios**.  The main problems are:
1) The transmitted sides is sensing if there is another sending a signal in the channel. In wireless is not possible to both transmit and receive (*at least with 1 antenna*), the problem is that you transmit your signal with high energy, the one you receive has low energy, so it happens that you do not recognized the other. With wireless transreceiver you cannot detect collision.
2) If a node is out of range, it may not note a collision, this problem is called **hidden terminal problem**
3) Exposed terminal problem: 

## Hidden terminal problem
![[Pasted image 20230225100029.png]]
The node A can receive and transmit to B because B it's in his radio range. The same happen to C: can transmit and receive to/from B and D because they are in C's radio range. 
The problem arise when A is sending to B and C senses the medium: *it will not hear A because its out of C's range* so if C start to transmit to anybody (*either B or D*) this **generate a collision at B. 
- **Hidden terminal problem**: C is not able to detect a potential competitor because it is out of range: a collision happens at B (*the receiver*). For the same reason A does not detect the collision so **C is hidden** with respect to the communication from A to B.
Usually this problem arises when *two or more stations which are out of range of each other transmit simultaneously to a common recipient*.

## Exposed terminal problem
![[Pasted image 20230225100636.png]]
The node B is transmitting to A: the node C wants to transmit to D so C senses the medium and because detect the B $\rightarrow$ A transmittion it concludes that cannot trasmit to D. But, **the two transmission can actually happen in parallel**. 
- **Exposed terminal problem**: C hears a transmission. C does not send to D despite its transmission would be Ok.  So **C is exposed** with respect to the communication from B to A. 
Usually this problem arises when *a transmitting station is prevented from sending frames due to interference with another trasmitting station*. 

The solution on wireless network is represented by **MACA Protocol**.

## MACA - Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
The basic udea is to stimulate the receiver into transmitting a short frame first and then transmit a long data frame. So stations hearing the short frame **refrain from transmitting** during the trasmission of the subsequent data frame. 
![[Pasted image 20230225101254.png]]

The scenario is the following:
- C is **within** range of A and **out** of range of B and D 
- D is **within** range of B and **out** of range of A and C 
- E is **within** range of both A and B

The protocol flows:
- **Step 1**: A wants to transmit to B so send a **RTS - Request To Send** packet to B: *the short frame* sended include also the length of the data frame that will eventually follow. 
- ![[Pasted image 20230225102406.png]]
- **Step 2**: B, C and E receive the **RTS** from A (*because they're in A's radio range*). 
	If B wants to receive the message, it replies with a **Clear To Send - CTS** that is a short frame with data length copied from RTS sended by A.
	![[Pasted image 20230225102447.png]]
- **Step 3**: the **CTS** sended by B is received by A, D, E
 ![[Pasted image 20230225102504.png]]
- **Step 4**: upon reception of the **CTS** frame by B, A (*whose the only interested in receiving*) start to transmit the data frame
 ![[Pasted image 20230225102530.png]]

**Problems**: 
1. **C hears the RTS from A but not the CTS from B** so it is free to transmit (*may be interested in transmitting)*. So **C is exposed**.
	![[Pasted image 20230225102559.png]]
2. **D hears CTS from B nut not RTS from A** so should stay silent until data framr transmission completes. So **D is hidden**. 
 ![[Pasted image 20230225102614.png]]

#### MACA collisions
Given the previous scenario, *what happen if anoter node out of the range of A and B wish to trasmit a message to node E?*
- C and B sends *RTS* simultaneosly to A: **the two RTS messages collide so no CTS message is generated**. 
- C and B use *Binary Exponential Backofff* to retry send the RTS. 

### MACAW: MACA for Wireless Network
Fine tunes MACA to improve performance:  
- introduces an **ACK frame** to acknowledge a successful data frame 
- added **Carrier Sensing** to keep a station from transmitting RTS when a nearby station is also transmitting an RTS to the same destination 
- exponential backoff is run for each separate pair source/destination and not for the single station 
- mechanisms to exchange information among stations and recognize temporary congestion problems 
- CSMA/CA used in IEEE 802.11 is based on MACAW
